Mohsen Namjoo,"Mohsen Namjoo (Persian: محسن نامجو) was born in 1976 in Torbat-e Jam, Iran. When he was one year old, his family moved to Mashhad where he spent the next seventeen years of his life. When he was 12 his father, Mohammad Hossein Namjoo, died. A few months later, his family encouraged him to start attending music classes. He started classical Persian vocal music with Ali Shakeri and solfège with Kaivan Alaee. Soon after, he got to know Ali Shakeri through Nasrollah Nasehpoor on a trip to Tehran. At that time, Ali Shakeri was a student of Nasrollah Nasehpoor. After almost a year of sessions with Ali Shakeri, Nasrollah Nasehpoor started to have weekly music sessions in Mashhad. This was a great opportunity for the young Namjoo to learn classical Persian vocal music from one of the most highly regarded masters of traditional Iranian singing. He attended these classes until the age of 18.

In 1994 he was offered admission to study Music at University of Tehran. Since the music program at the university would not start for another year, he took two theater classes at the University of The Arts. Namjoo always recalls the two theater classes and that one year period of time to be the time which shaped many parts of his work and his life. At Tehran University he was a student of Alireza Mashayekhi and Azin Movahed and other masters. In 1997, Namjoo quit the music program in University of Tehran, later explaining that he had some conflicts with certain faculty in the music department because they wanted to put him through more years of traditional Iranian music practice which were the repetition of what he had already learned in the earlier years of his life."

Mohammadreza Shajarian,"Mohammad-Rezā Shajariān(Persian: محمدرضا شجريان) (born September 23, 1940 in Mash'had, Iran; died October 8, 2020 in Tehran) was a legendary and critically acclaimed Persian traditional singer, composer and Ostad (master) of Persian music. During his life he was called ""Iran's greatest living master of Persian Classical music"". In Persian classical Dastgah music, singing is the most difficult art to master and Shajarian is the embodiment of the perfect singer and a major source of inspiration. Shajarian was also known for his skills in Persian calligraphy, and humanitarian activities.

Mohammad Reza Shajarian began singing spiritual songs at the age five under the supervision of his father. Only a few years later his precocious talent was to be renowned throughout the town of Mashhad. In spite of his religious upbringing, at the age of twelve he was familiarizing himself with the traditional song repertoire and the first piece he was to sing was the Gham-Angiz Goosheh of Dashti. He was also interested at the same time in popular music from Khorasan and the other regions of Iran. His focus at first was on the local folk music of his native province, Khorasan, but later at the age of twelve he studied the traditional repertoire, the Radif. After college, he became a schoolteacher and was to find himself at much greater liberty to study all forms of Persian traditional music and gradually relinquish religious singing. What follows is a resume of the major landmarks in Mohammad Reza Shajarian's artistic career. On the arrival in Teheran he met Ahmad Ebadi, the great Setar master who was sole heir to the musical tradition upheld by his family. His meeting of the late Esmail Mehrtash was to initiate him in the fine nuances of traditional singing, in popular melodies and in artistic technique.

Right from the earliest age he learned how to sing the different versions of the Radif from the most highly reputed singers such as Reza Gholi Mirza Zelli, Ghamar Molook Vaziri, Eghbal Azar, Taj Esfahani, Noor Ali Boroomand and Taher Zadeh Esfahani. Shajarian started playing the Santour under the instructions of Jalal Akhbari to better understand and perform the traditional repertoire, and in 1960, To improve his technique, became the pupil of the Santour Maestro Faramarz Payvar which lead to his acquiring perfect interpretative and executant mastery on instrument phrases transposed for the voice.

Shajarian was deeply inspired by the late master vocalist Gholam Hossein Banan and adopted his style of singing for several years. An important event in his life was his productive encounter with the great master Abdollah Davami, who was to impart to him the most ancient Tasnifs (songs) and the authentic version of the Radif which had been passed onto him by the greatest masters of the previous century.

Shajarian started his singing career in 1959 at Radio Khorasan. He rose to prominence in the 1960s with his distinct style of singing. Since then, he has led an illustrious career that includes teaching at Tehran University's department of Fine Arts (among other places), researching the musical arts of Iran, and working at the National Radio and Television. He performed regularly in Iran and throughout the world. His performances brought him universal acclaim and an eminent position among his compatriots.
Shajarian collaborated with Parviz Meshkatian, Mohammad Reza Lotfi, Hossein Alizadeh, and Faramarz Payvar. He was recognised as skilled singer in the challenging traditional Dastgah style. In 1999 UNESCO in France presented him with the Picasso Award and in 2006 with the UNESCO Mozart Medal.

Besides his tremendous musical talent, Shajarian had a life-long passion for Persian Calligraphy. Since 1967 he practiced this art under the instructions of two Iranian master calligraphers, Ebrahim Buzari, and Hossein Mirkhani. He was considered an accomplished calligrapher with his own distinct style."
Dariush,"Dariush Eghballi (born February 4, 1951) is a Persian (Iranian) pop singer (see also داریوش). Dariush Eghbali was born in Miyaneh and spent his early years in Karaj and Kurdistan. His talent was first recognized at an early age of nine, when he appeared on stage at his school. Hassan Khayatbashi introduced him to the public at the age of twenty through Iranian television. He immediately became popular with his legendary song ""Do not tell me you love me"" his contemporary and unique style opened a new era in the Iranian music.

Dariush has never compromised his deeply held beliefs, for which he was even imprisoned and persecuted before the revolution in Iran. Whether he sings poems of Shamlou, Rumi, Hafez,shirazi and Naderpour, or lyrics of Iraj Jannati Attaie, Shahyar Ghanbari, Mina Assadi and Ardalan Sarfaraz, the one theme that runs through all his music is that of love, peace, freedom and justice. He has collaborated with such renowned artists as Babak Bayat, Farid Zoland, Ahmad Pejman, Mohammad Shams, Varoujan and many other innovative and avant guarde lyricists, musicians, and composers.

His body of work consists of over 200 songs in 25 albums. With remarkable sensitivity and undeniable logic, he has created an astonishing repertoire and a glorious body of work. He has the ability to interpret all forms of music with consummate ease. He has dazzled audiences with great virtuosity with his bright and effervescent performances. He has had sold out performances in concert hall around the world notably: Wembley, Carnegie Hall, Kennedy Center, Koncertoes, Greek Theatre, Universal Amphitheatre, and Palais de Congres.

Furthermore, his performances in the Iranian Cinema, more specifically in two films: ""Yaran"" and ""Faryad zir-e- ab"" have earned great reviews[citation needed]. Recently, his incredible amount of sheer hard work in bringing awareness and support to the world of addiction has insured his place among the mere handful of humanitarian Iranian artists who have made an impact in the lives of people with compassion and passion. Through the establishment of the Iran Recovery Center, and Ayeneh Foundation, by creating such websites as [Behboudi.com], the first Persian website addressing substance abuse, [Ayeneh.org], the first and only website addressing all social maladies widespread among our countrymen all around the world, and his own weblog, [dariusheghbali.com]; through educational seminars and conferences around the world, and as a member of Amnesty International[citation needed], Dariush has raised his voice to make a difference. His goal is to create a nurturing environment conducive to allowing people to develop healthy, drug free lives, encouraging them and their family and loved ones to acquire and seek the skills to achieve sobriety and successfully maintain it, to bring social awareness regarding the plight of our countrymen and to create a bridge between those in need and those who can lend a helping hand. As such, his contributions have been recognized by the Self-Help And Recovery Exchange, which selected him to receive the Ron Simmons & Rev, Ronald L. Wright Award, for his outstanding contribution to support group participation by minority communities.

Dariush and his music have swept the worldwide musical scene with such haunting and powerful voice that could break a heart. His inherent musicality and intelligence and the astonishing beauty of his timbre, coupled with a passionate belief in the importance of civil liberties and political and human rights has made him an international symbol of a free Iran. He has been a messenger of love and compassion to the refugees all around the world struggling to find a tiny nest away from the tyranny and suppression. As such, he has been embraced by the Arab world, with its rich musical culture, with great enthusiasm. In a recent international festival of music video and tele-media held in Bahrain, Dariush was recognized as the sole representative of contemporary Iranian music. He was awarded the highest peace trophy[citation needed]. In the closing ceremonies of the festival, Dariush sang of freedom, particularly in his homeland, Iran, and passionately expressed his firm commitment towards being the voice of awareness, bringing attention to the plight of his countrymen struggling for freedom.

His flawless taste in music, poetry and lyrics, and his magnificent ability to touch the souls of his countrymen have been the main source of his enduring style. His engaging personality and his fierce loyalty to the need of the society has undoubtedly proven to be inspiring to the younger generation. This ever-growing impact on the younger generation, who were not even born when he began his career, as well as those who are avidly following his every move is generating over 200,000 hits a day on his website Dariush2000.com. Dariush transcends the world of popular and traditional Iranian music that he has commanded for over three decades, and has awarded the most glorious spot in the heart and soul of his countrymen all over the world."

The phenomenal success of these concerts was testament not only to her lasting quality as an artist, but a tribute to generations of Iranians who, despite over two decades of silence, demonstrated their continuing love and loyalty to an enduring star of a bygone era. In turn she rewarded their devotion with proof that she continues to remain relevant to today's audiences, showing that she is a star not only of the past, but of the present and the future."

Shadmehr Aghili,"Shadmehr Aghili ( born 1973) is an Iranian musician, singer and songwriter born in Tehran, Iran.

Shadmehr's father, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, died when Shadmehr was only a young student. Young Shadmehr began studying music with the encouragement of his brother and mother. He learned to play the piano and the violin just before he was 12 years old. The guitar is also an instrument which Shadmehr learned to play in a dexterous manner. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, he entered a school of arts in Tehran and in a short time showed great intelligence in composing and playing music. As a child Shadmehr was influenced by Persian pop star Siavash Shams and other singers like Andy.

After receiving a music diploma, when pop music was forbidden in Iran, Aghili entered the ""music school of television"". Around 1995 the first pop music permitted after the revolution was played on official Iranian television. This was dramatic music with Ahmad Shamlou's poetry read by Khashayar Etemadi.

Aghili composed a great deal of music for other singers. Finally, in 1997, his first album was presented, Bahareman (""My spring""), which was a collection of classic and folkloric music played and arranged by Aghili (violin, guitar, piano, keyboard). In the same year his voice was heard in Mabood, his first vocal music, and afterward he continued work that resulted in Mosafer (""The traveler""), his first complete vocal album. In 1999 he created a revolutionary album, Dehati (""The villager""), with rock and roll, 6'n'8 and popular rhythms. However, none of his songs were permitted to be played on public media (i.e. TV). Shadmehr worked hard to get a permission for his Adam o Hava (Adam & Eve), an album that was supposed to be released in 2001. However, not only he did not, but also, he was banned to work as a singer, musician, or to appear on TV shows.

Having left with no better choice, he decided to leave Iran in 2002, in order to continue his music in Canada, away from any restrictions. Khiali Nist (""No Worries""), Adamforoush (""Traitor"", 2004) and ""Popcorn"" are his most recent albums released in Canada and the United States. In addition, Shadmehr acted in two movies, namely, Pare Parvaz (2000) and Shabe Berahneh(2001).

In October 2006, Shadmehr entered the United States to perform a U.S. tour with his first concert date scheduled for November 17, 2006 at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shadmehr Aghili is now living with his wife, Mia Mesa, in Los Angeles California.

Kourosh Yaghmaei,"Kourosh Yaghmaei (Persian: کورش يغمائي) is one of the first Iranian rock musicians.
Kourosh was 10 when his father gave him a gift that revealed his talent for music. It was a Santour (the Persian traditional string-percussive dulcimer).

In fact Kourosh introduced Rock music to Iran with a Pop formation of songs. At that time he received several tempting offers from western musicians and bands' managers to join them.

In his senior year as a Social Science student at the Iran National University (DANESHGHAH-e MELLI-e IRAN), Kourosh released his first single hit GOL-e YAKH. The poem was written by his classmate, now-famous poet Mahdi Akhavan Langeroudi. This memorable love song led him to worldwide fame. He orchestrated, composed, played and sang the song. The song received international attention. It was re-played and sang in several other languages by their local musicians. His voice was banned for 17 years after The islamic revolution in 1979.

Hayedeh performed her first hit song ""Azadeh"" which was composed by Tajvidi on the lyrics of Rahi Mo'ayeri. Performing this work with Golha Orchestra in 1968 at Radio Tehran introduced Hayedeh's vocal talent to Persians who warmly received it. ""Azadeh"" which was composed by music by Ali Tajvidi, and was written by Rahi Moayeri was Hayedeh's first official hit. It was first performed in 1968 on Radio Tehran with the Gol-ha Orchestra and was later released by Ahang-e Rooz Records.
In the 1970s Hayedah added Persian pop music to her Persian classical repertoire. In this period Hayedeh worked with several songwriters, such as Fereydoun Khoshnoud, Jahanbakhsh Pazouki, Anoushiravan Rohani and Mohamad Heydari. ""Bezan Tar"", ""Gole Sang"", ""Norooz Amad"", ""Eyde To, Eyde Man"" and ""Soghati"" were among her memorable works during this period.

On August 29, 1978 shortly before the Iranian Revolution, Hayedeh emigrated to the United Kingdom. She stayed there for three years and moved to the United States in 1982 to continue her career and live close to her sister Mahasti.
Hayedeh lived in Los Angeles from 1982 until the end of her life. The growth of the Persian community in Southern California due to the increasing number of people leaving Iran after the revolution bolstered Hayedeh's career in the 1980s. Heyedeh released many successful albums during this time and many songs of her were bootlegged in Iran as well. Hayedeh's political and nostalgic songs such as ""Roozaye Roshan Khodahafez"" and ""Faryad"" became very popular with the Persian (Iranian) exile community. Some of her other hits were ""Shabeh Eshgh"", ""Gol Vajeh"", ""Ravi"", ""Bahaneh"", ""Eshareh"", ""Ghesseye Man"", ""Zendegi"" and ""Nargeseh Shirazi"".

Hayedeh's songwriters in the US were mostly Farid Zoland, Sadegh Nojouki, Mohammad Heydari and Andranik. Lyricists she worked with were Ardalan Sarfaraz, Homa Mir-Afshar, Iraj Razmjou but the lyricist who wrote most of Hayedeh's songs and hits was her best friend Leila Kasra (a.k.a. Hadieh). She was featured in two of her albums reading her songs. Kasra died in 1989 a few months prior to Hayedeh's death, after a long struggle with breast cancer.
During the 80's Hayedeh played sold-out venues in the US, Canada, Europe, and other places in the world. Hayedeh regularly appeared on the Los Angeles Persian TV channels such as Jaam-E-Jam TV and IR TV. In some of her TV programs. Hayedeh criticized Iran's fundamental regime and was a supporter of monarchy.

Hayedeh married and divorced three times and had three children named Kamran, Keyvan and Noushin Nouri, all of whom live in the US. Her eldest grandson ""Soheil"", who is the first born son of Keyvan Nouri, is currently pursuing a career as a freelance composer in Los Angeles. The public fascination with Hayedeh's personal life, as is true for all great performers, attracted a great deal of scrutiny of her private affairs. However, as is customary, most of Haydeh's so-called trivia were based on rumors.

On the afternoon of Saturday January 20, 1990, the day after her concert at the Casablanca Club in San Francisco, California, Hayedeh died from a heart attack at the age of 47. Hayedeh had complained of discomfort since the morning but her doctor in Los Angeles had assured her that it was nothing serious. Hayedeh had a history of heart problem, diabetes and hypertension. She also had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and was a smoker which led to her poor health shortly before her death. Her father was also a diabetic who died from a heart attack. Her two older brothers died of heart attacks, as well. She also dealt with depression after being exiled from Iran up until her death.
Hayedeh's death shocked and saddened Persians around the world. On January 24, 1990, Hayedeh was buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Her funeral was attended by thousands and most of the Persian singers and entertainers in exile.
Khosrow Motarjemi, a Persian IT expert in California, recorded a video of this three and a half hour concert, which for unknown reasons has never been officially released. That night Hayedeh told the audience: ""Life is like an express train...I am going to the House of God. Who knows what will happen in the future; I may not be alive tomorrow..."", then she performed one of her last songs, ""Shabe Meykhooneh"" (Man Mikham Be Khoune ye Khoda Beram) (I want to go to the House of God). The song’s lyricist, Leila Kasra (Hedieh) who was Hayedeh's best friend, died of cancer a few months before Hayedeh.
Hayedeh was recording an album shortly before her death and was due to finish recording it after she returned from her concert in San Francisco. Hayedeh was last interviewed one week before her death. The magazine which had the interview was released a day after her death, the issue became a bestseller. In the interview Hayedeh said that she was tired of rumors about her and said that she was going to continue her work and expand it even more.

Hayedeh's albums are ageless masterpieces and are still best sellers. Her songs are constantly played on Persian TV and radio channels. Many covers of her songs are sung by famous Persian pop singers. 
According to Prof. Erik Nakhjavani in Encyclopædia Iranica: ""Analogues to Delkash, before her, Hayedeh sang with technical authority and passionate energy. Her laryngeal control made it possible for her to produce a series of graceful vibrato and glissando vocalizations required by the Avaz Persian vocal music. She could smoothly pass from the upper reaches of her alto voice to the lower, fuller, and darker range of the contralto. This mixture of strong laryngeal strength and learned vocal technique gave her alto-contralto voice a rare, powerful resonance and texture in the performance of the Avaz. Furthermore an acute sense for musical timing, the rhythmic flow of vocal music, affective musical phrasing, and poetic delivery enabled her to express and interpret effectively any songs she sang.""

معصومه دده بالا با نام هنری هایده (۲۱ فروردین ۱۳۲۱ - ۳۰ دی ۱۳۶۸) خواننده ایرانی با صدای کنترآلتو است که بیست و یک سال در زمینه موسیقی دستگاهی و موسیقی پاپ ایرانی فعالیت داشت.
هایده در تهران متولد شد. نام اصلی او معصومه دده بالا بود. خواهر کوچک‌تر او - مهستی - نیز از خوانندگان معروف ایرانی است که حدود سه سال پیش از هایده خوانندگی را آغاز کرد.
هایده در ۱۳۴۷، فعالیت حرفه‌ای خود را با خواندن ترانه «آزاده» اثر استادش علی تجویدی که بر روی آخرین سروده رهی معیری ساخته شده بود آغاز کرد. اجرای ترانه «آزاده» با ارکستر بزرگ گل‌ها در رادیو تهران آغاز کار هایده بود. وی پس از اجرای چندین اثر دیگر از تجویدی و دیگر آهنگسازان در برنامه گلها، از نخستین سال‌های دهه ۱۳۵۰ به خواندن ترانه‌های پاپ علاقه‌مند شد که بیشتر از ساخته‌های فریدون خشنود، جهانبخش پازوکی، محمد حیدری و انوشیروان روحانی بودند.
هایده در شهریور ۱۳۵۷ چندین ماه پیش از پیروزی انقلاب ایران را به مقصد بریتانیا ترک کرد. او تا پایان عمر از این رویداد به عنوان تلخ‌ترین خاطره زندگی خود یاد می‌کرد.
هایده از ۱۳۶۱ در لس آنجلس به فعالیت ادامه داد.

آلبوم‌ها
در دهه‌های ۱۳۴۰ و ۱۳۵۰ آثار هایده در ایران به صورت صفحه گرامافون و نوار کاست منتشر شد. بیشتر این آثار و همچنین کارهایی که هایده در دهه ۱۹۸۰ در آمریکا خواند، در دهه ۱۹۹۰ و همچنین ۲۰۰۰ از نو روی سی‌دی منتشر شدند. قرار دادن ترانه‌ها در سی‌دی‌ها اغلب از نظم ویژه‌ای پیروی نمی‌کند.
دو آلبوم پایانی هایده «ای زندگی سلام» و «سوگند» رسما به شکل آلبوم روی نوار و سی‌دی منتشر شده‌اند.

نام سی‌دی‌های منتشر شدهٔ دیگر از هایده که بیشتر نام یکی از ترانه‌های سی‌دی را بر خود دارند عبارتند از:

بیشتر ترانه‌های هایده در سال‌های پیش از انقلاب در تلویزیون ملی ایران و پس از انقلاب در تلویزیون جام‌جم در لس آنجلس و بخشی دیگر نیز در تلویزیون ایرانیان و تلویزیون جنبش ملی ایران در جنوب کالیفرنیا به صورت نماهنگ (موزیک-ویدئو) در آمد.

هایده در روز ۲۰ ژانویه ۱۹۹۰ برابر با ۳۰ دی ماه ۱۳۶۸ فردای اجرای کنسرت در باشگاه کازابلانکا در حومه سان فرانسیسکو، بر اثر سکته قلبی درگذشت. پیکر او در گورستان وست وود در لوس آنجلس با حضور هزاران نفر از ایرانیان مقیم آمریکا به خاک سپرده شد. هما سرشار (روزنامه‌نگار)، ویگن (خواننده) و حسن شهباز (مترجم و سردبیر فصلنامه رهاورد) از جمله سخنرانان در مراسم بودند.
ویدئوی مراسم به فاصله کوتاهی، مخفیانه در ایران پخش شد.

مستند
پژمان اکبرزاده فیلم مستندی درباره فعالیت‌های هنری و آثار هایده ساخته که در ژانویه ۲۰۰۹ برای نخستین بار در آمستردام اکران شد.
این مستند یکصد دقیقه‌ای با عنوان «سخن از هایده» دربرگیرنده بررسی فعالیت‌های هایده، گزیده‌ای از اجراهای او در سبک‌های گوناگون و گفتگو با دوستان و همکاران نزدیک اوست. مستند در جشنواره فیلم نور در لوس آنجلس نامزد دریافت جایزه بهترین مستند شد اما به گزارش تلویزیون فارسی بی‌بی‌سی، «برخی از بستگان و دوستداران هایده به دلیل بازگویی بی پرده برخی مسایل به آن اعتراض کردند»؛ از سویی در تهران، مستندساز از سوی خبرگزاری فارس به دلیل ساخت فیلم درباره «خواننده معلوم الحال طاغوتی» مورد انتقاد قرار گرفت.

مستند «سخن از هایده» بیستم ژانویه ۲۰۱۰ در بیستمین سالگرد درگذشت هایده، توسط شبکه ایرانیان هلند منتشر شد و نسخه کوتاه شدهٔ آن نیز از شبکه فارسی تلویزیون صدای آمریکا پخش شد. در ژوئن ۲۰۱۰، کمی پیش از نمایش فیلم در جشنواره ایرانیان سیاتل، «روز آنلاین» در نقدی، مستند را «تلنگری برای یادآوری فضای شوم دهه شصت» خواند."

Farhad,"Farhad Mehrad (Persian: فرهاد مهراد) widely known in Iran as Farhad (January 20 1944, Tehran, Iran - August 31 2002, Paris, France), was a Persian legendary singer/musician. He rose to prominence among Iranian classical/folk musicians before the Islamic Revolution, but after the revolution he was banned from singing for several years. His first concert after 1978 was held in San Francisco in 1997. Farhad CDs are available from his  official website  
Farhad was born in Tehran. His father was Reza Mehrad, an Iranian diplomat who worked in the Arabic countries for the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs. Being the youngest child he always behaved differently than his family members and everyone assumed he was trying to act like an adults.
When Farhad was three years of age his love for music was noticed when he stayed outside his brothers' room, listening to his Violin lessons. His family bought Farhad a Cello and he started taking lessons. After 3 lessons, his Chello broke and as Farhad describes ""the instrument broke into pieces so did my soul"". That was the end of the Chello for Farhad and his love and passion for music ended up to be only listening to his brother playing the Violin.
When he went to school he found a passion for literature. He decided to study literature in high school but with the absence of his father, his uncle forced him to study science despite his weak results on all other subjects other than literature and English language. His interest being ignored; he quit high school on the 11th year, because he had no love for what he was studying.
After quitting high school he met an Armenian music band, using their instruments he learnt music by experience and after a while he became the guitar player in the band. The band went to southern Iran to perform for the Iranian Oil Company Club. One of the biggest organizations in Iran with many foreign employees. Before the start of the first nights' performance, the band made Farhad sing, the excuse was the vocalists' absence. Farhads' great attention and fuss for correct pronunciation of the words, and his knowledge of world literature came as a good advantage; when he preformed a few songs in Italian, French and English, it was hard to believe his mother tongue was Farsi. That led to the band's success and they preformed for an extended number of nights.
After a while Farhad quit the band and started his solo career. In 1964 he performed a few English songs on an Iranian TV show, where he captured the attention of more people.

Later in an event sponsored by ""EtelaÃt Javanan""; a popular youth magazine, he preformed in ""Amjadie"" Stadium. He played a few songs with the guitar which was followed by a huge crowd response. That was when ""Shahbal Shabpareh"" , the front man of the Iranian popular band ""Black Cats"" found out about Farhad.
Sometime later Shahbal and Farhad met and Farhad joined the Black Cats as a vocalist, the guitar player and the piano player. The Black Cats members were Shahbal Shabpareh (the percussions), Shahram Shabpareh (the Guitar), Hassan Shamaizadeh (the saxophone), Hamou (the Guitar) and Manouchehr Eslami (the trumpet). The band started playing in ""Couchini Club"".
Manouchehr Eslami called Farhad the most important member of the band; ""Despite the fact he couldn't read music sheets and had learnt the music by listening and playing by experience, Farhad did not need to attend the practice sessions. By whispering the song a few times he could cooperate his voice and instrument with the other band members. In fact he attended the sessions only for the respect of other band members"" said Eslami.
In the busiest and most successful time of the band, the first Farsi song of Farhad, called ""Age Ye Jo Shans Dashtim"" (With a little bit of Luck) was used in the movie ""Banooye Zibaye Man"" (My Fair Lady).

After a while Farhad left the Black Cats to take care of his sick sister in England. Farhad met a famous producer and he was offered a record deal by him. Farhad became ill and due to his illness and personal problems the deal never took place. The journey which was supposed to last for two months, took one year.

In 1969 Farhad sang ""Marde Tanha"" (the lonely man) for the movie ""Reza Motori"" (The Biker Reza). The song was composed by Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh and the lyrics where written by Shahyar Ghanbari. After the release of the movie, the song was released on gramophone discs and Farhad became a legendary star.
Farhad only sang songs which had a message and he believed in their messages. That's why after Marde Tanha he only released 3 singles during the years of 1971-1973. Those where ""Jomeh"" (The Friday) ""Hafteh Kakestari"" (The Gray Week) and ""Ayeneh"" (The Mirror).

Before the Iranian 1979 Islamic Revolution and during the political conflicts of the 1970s in Iran, Farhad recorded 6 songs with revolutionary massages that became the Iranians voice of unity.
The day after the Iranian revolution, 11th of February 1979, his song ""Vahdat"" (unity) was broadcasted from Iranian television[1] in the honour of revolution and freedom.

After revolution, the Islamic government turned its back on Farhad and refused to grant him permission to publish his album many times. Even the song ""Vahdat"" -which was considered a song in honer of the revolution- was refused permission to be released, the government's reason was the song is nothing new; but the fact was the Islamic Government was concerned about his popularity and his influence on people. The government wanted Farhad to be forgotten

In 1993, after 15 years of silence, Farhad was granted permission to release his first album ""Khab Dar Bidari"" (Sleep While Awake) and it went straight to the top of the charts just after its release.
After this album Farhad lost hope in the Iranian governments' grant of permission system and he released his next album ""Barf"" (Snow) in the United States in 1999. Barf was released in Iran a year later.

After Barf Farhad decided to record an album with songs from different countries and in different languages. He decided to call the album ""Amin"" (Amen) he started recording; but death stopped him from finishing it.
On September 2000, Farhad's illness became serious and on the 31st of August 2002, after 2 years of treatment in Iran and France, he died in Paris.
Farhad was 59 years of age when he died; he is resting in peace in the Thiais cemetery in Paris.

فرهاد مِهراد (۲۹ دی ۱۳۲۲ در تهران - ۹ شهریور ۱۳۸۱ در پاریس) معروف به فرهاد؛ خواننده، آهنگ‌ساز و نوازندهٔ پاپ راک اهل ایران بود.]

فرهاد از خوانندگان راک ایرانی بود و نخستین آلبوم راک اند رول ایران را منتشر کرد.

او به عنوان یکی از سیاسی‌ترین خوانندگان ایران شناخته می‌شود. فرهاد در اوایل دهه ۱۳۵۰ شعرهایی با مضامین سیاسی می‌خواند و مدتی زندانی سیاسی بود. فرهاد بعداً از انقلابیون شد و در زمستان ۱۳۵۷ ترانه انقلابی «وحدت» را خواند، اما پس از انقلاب تا سال ۱۳۷۲ از ادامه کار منع شد.

آنچه فرهاد را از دیگر همدوره‎هایش متمایز می‎کند، ترانه‎های پوچ‌گرا و فرهنگ خیابانی است که در موسیقی او متبلور شده‎است. این عناصر در ترانه مشهور «کودکانه» بیش از پیش نمود دارد

از دیگر ترانه‌های مشهور او می‌توان به «جمعه»، «گنجشکک اشی‌مشی»، «شبانه»، «هفته خاکستری» و «مرد تنها» اشاره کرد. فرهاد آهنگ‎هایی نیز غیر فارسی به زبان های انگلیسی آلمانی و فرانسه نیز دارد
.
سال‌های کودکی
فرهاد ۲۹ دی ۱۳۲۲ در تهران متولد شد. پدرش رضا مهراد، کاردار ایران در کشورهای عربی بود. فرهاد تا ۸ سالگی که به همراه خانواده به تهران بازگشت در عراق زندگی می‌کرد. برادر بزرگ فرهاد ویولن می‌نواخت. یکی از دوستان برادرش متوجه علاقهٔ فرهاد به موسیقی می‌شود و از خانواده فرهاد می‌خواهد که سازی برای او تهیه کنند. با اصرار برادرش یک ویولن‌سل برای او تهیه می‌کنند و تمرینات فرهاد آغاز می‌شود. ولی عمر تمرینات ویولن‌سل از ۳ جلسه فراتر نرفت

سال‌های جوانی و شهرت

بعد از ترک تحصیل در کلاس یازدهم با یک گروه نوازندهٔ ارمنی آشنا می‌شود و با استفاده از سازهای آنان به صورت تجربی نواختن را می‌آموزد و مدتی بعد به عنوان نوازندهٔ گیتار در همان گروه شروع به فعالیت می‌کند. فرهاد دو سال نیز به انگلستان رفت و در آنجا با موسیقی پاپ آن سال‌های انگلستان آشنا شد.

پس از بازگشت به ایران فرهاد اولین اجرای موسیقی خود را در هتل ریمبو در خیابان ایرانشهر تهران اجرا کرد. سپس به اجرای برنامه در رستوران کوچینی ادامه داد و در آنجا به فرهاد بلک‌کَتس مشهور شد. در این دوران به خواندن آوازهایی از گروه‌های معروف موسیقی آن زمان از جمله بیتل‌ها، الویس پریسلی، و ری چارلز می‌پرداخت. در همین دوره ترانهٔ «اگه یه جو شانس داشتیم» را برای دوبلهٔ فیلم بانوی زیبای من خواند که در فیلم استفاده شد.

در ۱۳۴۸ فرهاد برای ترانهٔ «مرد تنها» (با آهنگ اسفندیار منفردزاده و شعر شهیار قنبری) در فیلم رضا موتوری (به کارگردانی مسعود کیمیایی) آواز خواند. این ترانه در سال ۱۳۴۹ هم‌زمان با اکران فیلم به شکل صفحهٔ موسیقی منتشر شد. در ۱۳۵۰ ترانهٔ «جمعه» (کار منفردزاده و قنبری) را برای فیلم خداحافظ رفیق (به کارگردانی امیر نادری)، در ۱۳۵۱ ترانهٔ «خسته» را برای فیلم زنجیری، و در ۱۳۵۶ ترانهٔ «سقف» (کار منفردزاده و ایرج جنتی عطایی) را برای فیلم ماهی‌ها در خاک می‌میرند خواند.

در همین سال‌ها (اوایل دههٔ ۱۳۵۰) فرهاد با دختری به نام مونیکا آشنا شد و با او ازدواج کرد اما سرانجام این ازدواج جدایی بود. بعدها یعنی در اواخر همین دهه فرهاد با پوران گلفام ازدواج کرد و تا پایان عمر با او زندگی کرد.

تا سال ۱۳۵۷ و انقلاب ایران کنسرت‌های فراوانی داد. در بهمن ۱۳۵۷ هم‌زمان با انقلاب ترانهٔ معروفش «وحدت» (آهنگ از منفردزاده، شعر از سیاوش کسرایی) را ضبط کرد.

پس از انقلاب مدت‌ها از کار منع شد تا بالاخره در ۱۳۶۹ آلبوم خواب در بیداری را منتشر کرد که چند ترانهٔ فارسی و چند ترانهٔ انگلیسی داشت. در این نوار فرهاد پیانو هم می‌نواخت و بعضی از آهنگ‌ها را هم خود ساخته بود. در ۱۳۷۴ نیز اولین کنسرت بعد از انقلابش را در کلن اجرا کرد.

در ۱۳۷۶ آلبوم وحدت او نیز منتشر شد که شامل ترانه‌های دههٔ ۱۳۵۰ او بود. در ۱۳۷۷ توانست در هتل شرق تهران کنسرت اجرا کند و آلبوم برف را نیز منتشر کرد.

سال‌های پایانی و بیماری
پس از انتشار آلبوم «برف»، فرهاد درصدد تهیه آلبومی با نام «آمین» بود که ترانه‌هایی از کشورها و زبان‌های مختلف را در بر می‌گرفت. اما از مهرماه ۱۳۷۹ بیماری او جدی شد. فرهاد به بیماری هپاتیت سی مبتلا بود و در نتیجهٔ عوارض کبدی ناشی از آن در خرداد ۱۳۸۱ برای درمان به لیل در فرانسه رفت و در ۹ شهریور همان سال پس از مدتی اغما در بیمارستان، در سن ۵۹ سالگی درگذشت و در ۱۳ شهریور در گورستان تیه (قطعه ۱۱۰، ردیف ۷، سنگ ۲۳) در پاریس دفن شد. پس از درگذشت فرهاد، مجموعه آثار و فیلم مستندی از او منتشر شد.

Axiom Of Choice,"Axiom of Choice is a world fusion group of Iranian émigrés who perform a mixing style incorporating Persian classical music and Western classical music.

Poignant, innovative, epic, and soulful - these are but a few of the adjectives used to describe the music of Axiom of Choice. Formed in 1992 by guitarist, composer and Artistic Director Loga Ramin Torkian and co-producer and percussionist Mammad Mohsenzadeh, the ensemble’s goal is to define a new sound within the context of Persian music. They were soon joined by vocalist Mamak Khadem whose prodigious vocal talent complemented the original compositions of Torkian.

The name of the ensemble is a mathematical term, which clearly defines their intentional freedom of choice within the parameters of their compositions and music. As artists who immigrated to the United States, Axiom of Choice incorporates the sounds of other cultures - both East and West - broadening the scope and appeal of their music while remaining loyal to their Persian roots and retaining the originality, distinctiveness and integrity of their sound. Their original compositions are mostly based on Persian melodies and modes and have universal appeal because of their cohesive, seamless and natural fusion with other styles of music.

The musicians work within a unique compositional structure in which both improvisation and personal expression can freely take place. One important goal is to make Persian music more accessible to the broader audience. The other is to communicate through a progressive and new global sound, unique to world music. Based on the quarter-tone guitar, saz, diwan (Middle Eastern lutes), Persian vocals, the Armenian duduk (oboe), clarinet, electric cello, and global percussion instruments, their sound is at the same time traditional and modern, Persian and yet global. The group’s music is self-expressive and powerful, adventurous and mysterious, contemplative and mournful, yet uplifting and cathartic.

Their first album “Beyond Denial” (X-Dot 25) was described as “Near Eastern art music, deeply moving and utterly beautiful” by Rhythm. Their second release “Niya Yesh” (Narada World) became the winner of NAV’s best contemporary world music album in 2001. They were nominated Best Recombinant World Music Ensemble in 2001 by the LA Weekly Music Awards. Their third album “Unfolding,” also on Narada World, is inspired by the Persian poet, mathematician, and astronomer Omar Khayyam and embraces his mystical poetry and vision.

About the members:
Loga Ramin Torkian is a guitarist, Middle Eastern lutist, composer and the Artistic Director of Axiom of Choice. Born in Iran, he moved to the United States after the revolution. When asked to speak about his musical background, he says: “The path to defining one’s music is never straight. I reflect upon the day I left my flamenco guitar teacher - disheartened by his truthful comment that after practicing for years, the only way to bring myself to professional standard would be to move to Spain, otherwise my playing would always have an accent. I knew I could not leave the United States for years to come and I felt I had reached an end. I did not realize then that I was about to discover something very unique within myself.”

Loga spent the next three years studying the tar, a Persian lute and joined for a short period a traditional ensemble by the name of Nava. But he quickly learned that he could not satisfy his creativity within the framework of traditional music. It was then that he decided to create the quarter-tone guitar to which he adapted many of the tar techniques and formed Axiom of Choice, which served as a common ground for other expatriates to work with him. “As an émigré artist, I have chosen to express myself in music that is not bound by the confines of traditional Persian music. Yet, my music in its very depth comes from that tradition,” says Loga who continues to use the radif (Persian repertoire) and Persian melodies as the source of his compositions. Many master musicians have welcomed his approach.

His innovative quarter-tone guitar retooled with movable frets also sets him apart as a guitarist allowing him to play Middle Eastern scales and create new ornamentations on the guitar. He also performs on other Middle Eastern string instruments such as the Turkish saz and the Kurdish diwan. His extensive travels around the world have been instrumental in developing his great sensitivity towards other cultures. He believes that any music that crosses over to other cultures should not only be appealing, but also fundamentally sound for the cultures involved. Loga has also been involved in composing music for films.

Mamak Khadem is the vocalist of the ensemble. Trained in the classical Persian style, by nature poignant, she weaves emotive textures ranging from bliss to pain, which give a mystical and nostalgic bent to the music. “When I think of my childhood, my memories are inseparable from the melodies that touched my soul when I was growing up. It was through establishing this personal relationship with music as well as my training at the Children Choir for National Radio and Television of Iran that my musical education began. But it was not until the late seventies and after the revolution that I truly became inspired to learn Persian traditional vocals.” Thus Mamak Khadem sums up her musical background. Like many other immigrants, Mamak discovered her cultural heritage after years of living abroad. The revolution in Iran and subsequently the immense amount of work produced in the early eighties by master musicians of that time became her source of inspiration. Since then, she has seized every opportunity to further her vocal art, regularly traveling back to Iran to study with some of the finest Persian vocalists and masters. In 1992, Mamak joined Axiom of Choice, which allowed her to experiment and define her own style. She has expanded her vocal art also by learning other methods of singing (such as classical Indian, and Bulgarian). Mamak believes that the path of learning is endless. However, one thing clear to her is that Persian vocal art can be successfully used outside of its traditional context.

“I love teaching children and singing”, says Mamak. These are the two main goals in her life and she has been fortunate enough to fulfill both by teaching mathematics and world culture classes to high school students. She has worked and recorded, among others, with Hans Zimmer (on the score of Peace Maker), Jamshied Sharifi, Tulku, Omar Faruk Tekbilek, Joel Mc Neally (on the soundtrack of the movie “Buffalo Soldier” and “Dark Angels” TV series), Jeff Rona, composer of the “Chicago Blues” TV series score, and Chris Beck, the composer of “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer” TV score.

Ruben Haratunian from Armenia is a foremost duduk, zurna and clarinet player. A prominent student of the legendary world-renowned Armenian duduk player, Djivan Gasparyan, Ruben is a graduate of the prestigious Aram Khatchaturian College of Music and the Komitas Conservatory and has established himself as a virtuoso performer and the finest duduk player to live in the United States and the West. Prior to relocating to the United States, he was the Director and soloist for T. Altounyan Armenian State Ensemble of Folk Singing and Dancing. He is currently the most active duduk player living in the United States and a recording artist who has performed at numerous prestigious venues. Dedicated to preserving the music of Armenia and the duduk tradition, he is the first duduk player of the Armenian ensemble Winds of Passion. Ruben is esteemed not only for the exquisite tonality of his duduk playing but also for his vast knowledge of the melodies and maqams (traditional motifs and modes) of not only Armenia but also of the surrounding region, including Iran, Kurdistan and Azerbaijan. In this capacity, he is unique. He joined Axiom of Choice in 2000.

Andre Harutyunyan from Armenia is a multi-percussionist who is highly sought after by world music, Armenian and Persian ensembles. He has recorded and performed with Djivan Gasparyan, Armen Chakmakian and Vas, among others. He has been a member of Axiom of Choice since 2000.

Around this period his songs drew a lot of attention. Moein continued to produce hit after hit. Such classics as Kabeh, Havas, Esfehan, Miparastam, Paricheh.

Faramarz Aslani,"Born July 13th, 1954
Tehran, Iran

Singer, Songwriter and Producer Faramarz Aslani (Persian : فرامرز اصلانی) is admittedly a rare phenomenon in the Iranian modern music. He writes his own lyrics & music, and he sings them accompanied by his stylish guitar playing.

He is a graduate of London University's College of Journalism and has written for several Persian and English publications, since his graduation in the early seventies.

Upon returning to his native country, he worked for one of two English dailies, ""Tehran Journal"" until he was spotted by the President of CBS, in Tehran.

His first album, ""Occupation of The Heart"", recorded for CBS in 1977, has remained on the best sellers chart since it's debut.

He also recorded a second album, ""Hafez, a Memorandum"", for the same company. In this album he wrote music on eight poems of Hafez, Iran's most famous poet and mystic.

After the 1979 revolution in Iran, he took his family back to England, where he worked both as a journalist and a musician. Faramarz has two daughters, Phaedra and Roxana, from his previous marriage. They are both successful artists, as well. Their latest album has been a hit in the United Kingdom.

His first tour of the United States began in 1992, when he opened at the Shrine Auditorium and was received by an eager and excited audience.

About his latest album he says: ""these songs are the addition of all the sweet and bitter memories of my life.""

""Days of Songs and Sorrow"" is a magnificent album. The lyrics are deep and captivating yet simple to absorb. The vocals are warm and sincere. At times, the artist's guitar becomes an inseparable element of this intricate work of art. A fan wrote: ""He sings with a passion that makes you fall in love and makes your heart ache!""

The songs are quite diverse, both in style and content. This is what makes Faramarz Aslani distinct.

In 2010, Faramarz released his first album since 1999 titled ""The Third Line"" (Khatte Sevvom) , in his first collaboration with independent record label Bamahang Productions."

Kayhan Kalhor,"Kayhan Kalhor (Persian: كيهان كلهر), born 1963, is an Iranian kamancheh player of Kurdish descent.
Kayhan Kalhor was born in Tehran, Iran. He began studying music at seven years of age. By age thirteen he was playing in the National Orchestra of Radio and Television of Iran. Continuing his music studies under various teachers, he studied in the Persian radif tradition and also travelled to study in the northern part of Khorasan province, where music traditions have Kurdish and Turkic influences as well as Persian. At a musical conservatory in Tehran around age 20 Kalhor worked under the directorship of Mohammad Reza Lotfi who is from Gorgan. Kalhor also travelled in the northwestern (Kurdish) provinces of Iran. He later moved to Rome and Ottawa to study European classical music.
Kayhan Kalhor has a wide range of musical influences, he uses several musical instruments, and crosses cultural borders with his work, but at his center he is an intense player of the Persian Kamanche. In his playing Kalhor often pins Persian classical music structures to the rich folk modes and melodies of the Kurdish tradition of Iran.

Kalhor has composed works for, and played alongside, the famous Iranian vocalists Mohammad Reza Shajarian (see Masters of Persian Music) and Shahram Nazeri. He has also composed and performed with the Indian sitar player Shujaat Husain Khan, the two forming a ghazal group and publishing several albums. Kalhor's 2004 album Mirror of the Sky was a joint venture with the Kurdish Iranian lute player Ali Akbar Moradi. Kalhor's most recent album The Wind (2006) is a collaboration with the Turkish baglama virtuoso Erdal Erzincan, with both Turkish and Persian pieces performed. At other times Kalhor has collaborated with Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project Ensemble in the USA and the Kronos Quartet.

Kalhor now resides in USA and has been commercially successful in USA over the past decade (two of his works were nominated for Grammy Awards in 2004)."
Amir Tataloo,""" امیرحسین مقصودلو "" ملقب به "" امیر تتلو "" در ۳۰ شهریورِ ۱۳۶۶ در مجیدیه تهران به دنیا آمد. دورانِ کودکی و نوجوانی برخلاف حالِ حاضر بسیار خجالتی و ساکت بود. موقعیت کارِ پدرش باعث شد که امیر دورانِ دبستان را در رشت سپری کند ولی بعد از چند سال به تهران برگشت و مقطعِ راهنمایی را در آنجا گذراند. شرایطِ مالیِ خانواده ی وی باعث شد که امیر از سنینِ نوجوانی علاوه بر تحصیل، به کار هم مشغول شود. او از سنِ ۱۴ تا ۱۶ سالگی در یک کارگاهِ نجاری شاگردی کرده و از سن ۱۶ تا ۱۸ سالگی هم در یک سوپر مارکت کار می کرد.
پس از پایانِ دوره ی دبیرستان، امیر به دنبال عشق همیشگی‌اش یعنی‌ موسیقی رفت. شروعِ کار او همزمان با شروعِ فعالیت دیگر هنرمندان قدیمی‌ِ زیرزمینی بود که با برخی‌ از آنها از جمله رضا پیشرو ، حسین تهی ، حسین ابلیس و چند تنِ دیگر همکاری هایی داشت. امیر با آهنگ هایی از قبیلِ "" برو از پیشِ من "" ، "" گربه صفت "" و "" ۱۰۰۱ شب "" طرفدارانِ این سبک را به خودش مجذوب کرد و تصمیم گرفت که سبکش را کمی‌ عامیانه تر کند و با تلفیقِ موسیقی‌ِ ۶/۸ و پاپ ، مخاطبانِ ایرانی‌ را که در آن زمان مخاطبِ موسیقی‌ِ لُس آنجلسی بودند به سمتِ موسیقی وطنی بیاورد ، که البته بعد از آهنگ‌های "" وای که چه حالیه "" و "" یکی‌ بهش زنگ بزنه "" به موفقیت‌های بسیار زیادی رسید ؛ سپس به دبی‌ رفت و مشغول به کار و همکاری‌های زیادی در آنجا شد.
پس از مدتی امیر به ایران برگشت و موردِ توبیخِ قانونی‌ قرار گرفت و از آن زمان تصمیم گرفت که قدم هایش را محتاطانه تر و با احترام به قوانینِ کشورش بردارد. این فراز و نشیب‌‌ها باعثِ تحولاتِ مثبتی در زندگی‌ِ امیر شد. او اکنون مخاطب‌های زیادی از طریقِ آهنگ‌های قبلیش کسب کرده و میتواند با اعتماد به نفسِ بیشتری به سبکش که تلفیقی از پاپ ، R&B و رپ هستش بپردازد که وی بعدها این سبک را "" تتلیتی "" نامید . آهنگ هایی از قبیلِ "" حسِّ معمولی‌ "" ، "" مغزِ در رفته "" و "" الو۲ "" نمونه هایی از این سبک هستند.

Habib then settled in the provinces of Western and Eastern Azerbaijan and eventually Tehran. Later he moved to the United States but returned home to Iran in 2009. Habib died on June 10, 2016 in Ramsar, Mazandaran, Iran, due to cardiac arrest.

Habib has many hit songs such as “Marde Tanhaye Shab”, “Shahla”, and “Madar”. The song “Shahla” was inspired after listening to an Azeri performer. However, there is a common misconception that Shahla has been inspired by Habib’s ex-wife (the name of his ex-wife is Shaadi and not Shahla).

In 2003, Habib took stage along with his son, Mohammad. While remaining loyal to his principles, Habib showed a bit more flexibility in producing music videos, going on stage, and more mainstream music to help with the career of his son. Their first common album was named Javooni with songs such as “Gheir-e-To”, “Nazaninam”, “Nameh”, a new version of the song “Madar”. The song “Gheir-e-To” starts with a famous music piece from the film The Message (shown frequently in Iran) that is mixed with Habib’s own romantic Persian song.

Habib travelled back to Iran and requested permission to put on a concert in Iran. He also produced a music video about his mother in Iran.

2. Habib Wahid, 
better known as Habib,  is a popular Bangladeshi composer and musician. He is notable for his fusion of traditional Bengali folk music with contemporary techno and urban beats. He takes folk music and remixes with popular music forms. He takes songs of composers like Hason Raja, Shah Abdul Karim, Amir Uddin and others and remixes the tunes with Hip-hop, reggae, rap and electronica.

Habib’s father Ferdous Wahid was one of the trailblazers of Bangla pop music in the 1970s and 1980s. Habib started to pick up tunes on his father’s keyboard from the time he was a little boy. Later, he studied music and audio engineering at the School of Audio Engineering in London. During this time, he had the opportunity to work with Asian Underground pioneer Nitin Sawhney among others.

Habib conceived his first folk-remix album Krishno while he was still a student in London. “I had the concept and even the tracks arranged…and was looking for a vocalist,” he said. Kaya, the vocalist Habib was looking for is a Sylheti restaurant owner in London and amateur singer. The first few songs arising from their collaboration proved to be unexpected hits on the underground scene, both in London and in Dhaka. Krishno was a success when it was eventually released in Bangladesh, its unique blend of age-old folk and modern electronica introducing a radically new sound to the Dhaka music scene.

Since then, Habib has released two more albums: Maya (2004) and Moyna Go (2005). Both have been bestsellers. His latest Eid album in Shono Habib features new voices in all his albums. Besides Kaya he uses Helal, Julie, Konica,and Nirjhor. In the album, “Moyna Go” Habib himself appears singing two new romantic songs. In “Moyna Go” he also has his father, Ferdous Wahid singing a song and a folk song sung by Milon Mahmood. Habib also has little rap, r&b, hip-hop, and reggae type add-ins to songs that fit things like that done by Kunle. Habib has established himself as one of the most popular and promising young musicians in the country.In October 2006 Habib released another album: Shono.

Habib is touring, with upcoming shows in Toronto and Montreal. Habib’s Canadian success is managed by Feroz Haq, who is the founder of the International Habib Fan Club (better known as I.H.F.C.). As Habib continues to gain international success, his future goals include “bringing the bohawk into the mainstream.” Despite of Habib’s popularity, he remains to be extremely modest, calling his work “average at best.” However, fans disagree and they’ve graced him with the nickname of “Voice Doctor (V.D).” For his contribution of different type of music he is referred by some as “Bengali A. R. Rahman”, an obvious reference to A R Rahman, a South Asian composer."
Salar Aghili,"Salar Aghili (born 1977) is an Iranian vocalist. He is one of the most famous musicians in traditional Iranian music.
Salar works with many famous music groups such as Tehran Symphonic Orchestra , Iran National Orchestra and Dastan Group. His first album ""eshgh maand"" was very popular. He has released four albums until now.

فريدون فروغی، چهارمين و آخرين فرزند خانواده‌ی فروغی در تاريخ 9/11/1329 در تهران متولد شد.
او در زمينه‌ی موسيقی هنرمند كاملی‌ست. زيرا علاوه بر خوانندگی، در نواختن گيتار، پيانو و ارگ مهارت خاصی داشته است و به كار آهنگسازی و ترانه نيز پرداخته است.
او تنها پسرخانواده بود و سه خواهر به نام‌های (پروانه، عفت و فروغ) داشت كه هم‌اكنون در قيد حيات می‌باشند.
فتح الله فروغی، كارمند اداره‌ی دخانيات بود، كه در تنهايی خود به سرودن شعر و نواختن تارمی‌پرداخت و از مالكان بزرگ روستای نراق ـ مابين قم و كاشان ـ به شمار می‌آمد.
فريدون فروغی، در سال 1335 ودر شش سالگی، تحصيل را آغاز كرد و در سال 1347 مدرك ديپلم علوم طبيعی را گرفت و پس از آن ديگر تحصيل را رها كرد.
فريدون فروغی، موسيقي را بدون داشتن استاد و يا معلم فرا گرفت و با توجه به كارهای راك  و بلوز (مخصوصا ری چارلز) به تمرين و يادگيری پرداخت.
در سال 1345، فریدون 16 ساله، با همراه ساختن گروهی نوازنده با خود موسيقی را به صورت جدی شروع می‌كند و در مكان‌های مختلف به اجرای ترانه‌ها و آهنگ‌های روز فرنگی و به خصوص موسيقی بلوز می‌پردازد و تا سن 18 سالگی كار خود را به همين صورت ادامه می‌دهد.
در سال 1350، خسرو هريتاش، كارگردان فيلم (آدمک) برای موسیقی متن فیلم خود به‌دنبال صدا و سبکی متفاوت با جریان آن سال‌های موسیقی ایران بود. فريدون فروغی توسط دوستی مشترك به او معرفی می‌گردد و با یک‌بار زمزمه‌ی ترانه خسرو هريتاش متوجه می‌شود شخصی را كه به دنبالش بوده را يافته است و ترانه‌ی آدمک و پروانه‌ی من توسط فروغی اجرا می‌شود و چندی بعد اين ترانه در صفحات 45 دور، درصفحه‌فروشی‌های معروفی چون (آل كوردوبس، پاپ، ديسكو، بتهوون و پارس) عرضه می‌گردد. اين دو ترانه گل می‌كند و بر سر زبان‌ها می‌افتد.

بعد از مدتی (فرشيد رمزي) كارگردان برنامه‌ی شوی تلويزيونی (شش وهشت) با فريدون فروغی قرارداد می‌بندد و فروغی درسال 1351 بعد از پنج سال مشابه‌خوانی آثار ری چارلز را كنار گذاشته و كارش را در تهران شروع می‌كند. اين همكاری باعث تولد آثاری چون زندون دل و غم تنهایی می‌گردد كه ترانه‌ی زندون دل فروغی را تبديل به هنرمندی صاحب سبک می‌كند.
درسال 1352 فروغی ترانه‌ی تنگنا را برای فيلم (اميرنادري) اجرا می‌كند و در همين سال به اجرای ترانه‌هایی چون نياز (ترانه‌ای از شهيارقنبري) و هواي تازه در برنامه‌ی رنگارنگ می‌پردازد.
در همين سال مجموعه آثار فریدون گردآوری شده و  اولين آلبوم او با نام «نياز» به بازار عرضه می‌شود.
دومين آلبوم فروغی به نام «ياران» درسال 1354 به بازار عرضه می‌شود ودرهمين سال به علت اجراي ترانه‌ی «سال قحطی» از طرف رژيم شاهنشاهی به مدت دو سال ممنوع الصدا می‌شود.
درسال 1356، پس از اعلام فضای باز سياسی توسط رژيم، فروغی بعد از دو سال ممنوعيت كاری، سومين آلبوم خود را با نام «سال قحطي» به بازار عرضه می‌كند.
در سال 1357، با وخيم شدن اوضاع سياسی ايران، فروغی اعتراض خود را به اوضاع كشور با انتشار آلبوم «بت شكن» اعلام می‌کند و در همين سال ترانه‌ای به نام روسپی اجرا می‌كند كه هرگز مجوز پخش نمی‌گيرد.
درسال 1358، بعد از انقلاب، فروغی در ايران ماند و كنسرت‌هایی را اجرا کرد. ترانه‌های اين كنسرت در آلبوم «فريدون فروغی درآغازی نو» منتشر می‌شود. از دلايل نام‌گذاری اين آلبوم به اين نام، اجرای ترانه‌های ريتميکی مانند حقه و شياد می‌باشد.
بعد از انتشار اين كاست، در سال 1359 فروغی ترانه‌ی یار دبستانی را برای فيلم (از فرياد تا ترور) به كارگردانی منصور تهرانی اجرا می‌كند و بعد از آن ترانه‌ی كوچه‌ی شهر دلم.
در سال 1360 چند ترانه ي خود را همراه با چند ترانه از كوروش يغمايي درآلبوم «سُل» جاي می‌دهد و در حوالی سال‌های 60 و 61 آهنگ چهار قسمتی «چرا نه؟!» را می‌سازد و اجرا می‌كند.
اما رفته‌رفته مهر سكوت بر لبان او سنگينی مي كند. پس از آن تنها خاموشی و تنهايی‌ست كه می‌ماند. ايجاد ممنوعيت كاری انگيزه‌ای براي فعاليت دوباره‌ی فروغی نمی‌گذارد. در اين سال‌ها تنها يار او خلوت و گوشه‌نشينی‌ست و علی‌رغم فشارهایی كه اين سكوت طولانی بر او تحميل می‌كند، هرگز تن به ترک وطن نمی‌دهد.
فروغی با اين شرايط عذاب‌آور به زندگی ادامه می‌دهد و در اسفند سال 1372 با خانم سوسن معادليان آشنامی‌شود و در خرداد 1373 با هم ازدواج می‌كنند. ازدواج با سوسن معادليان موجبات تحولی مثبت را در او فراهم می‌آورد و او دوباره فعاليت خود را از سر می‌گيرد، شعر می‌گويد، آهنگ می‌سازد و شروع به تدريس گيتار، ارگ و پيانو می‌كند.
سرانجام در اسفندماه سال 1377 و پس از حدود بیست سال، موفق به برگزاری كنسرتی در تالار حافظيه‌ی كيش می‌شود. پس از چهار روز برگزاری كنسرت در كيش، به تهران می‌آيد و علی‌رغم درخواست شهرستان‌های ديگر برای برگزاری كنسرت، با اين كار موافقت نمی‌شود و فروغی درتابستان 78 و پائيز 79 دوباره به كيش بازمی‌گردد و به اجرای برنامه در هتل آنای كيش می‌پردازد.
در سال 79 برای تيتراژ پايانی فيلم (دختری به نام تندر) قطعه‌ای از شاعران معاصررا می‌خواند و اميدوار می‌شود كه بتواند مجوز كارهايش را بگيرد
و در انتظار اكران فيلم می‌ماند.

پس از اينكه از گرفتن مجوز نااميد می‌شود گوشه‌نشينی را برمی‌گزيند و در روز جمعه سيزدهم مهر سال 1380 خود را از چنگ اين دنيای بی‌عشق می‌رهاند و به گفته‌ی شهيار قنبری: فريدون فروغی را فراموشی و خاموشی كشت.

اينك ما مي نويسیم از او، آثارش را در بازار موسيقي مي يابيم و حتي فيلم مستندي از زندگي او و گوشه اي از كنسرتهايش، كتاب او، ولي حالا چرا؟
نوشدارو پس از مرگ سهراب، حالا كه او رفته، ويژه نامه اي براي او، و همه چيز از او حالا كه ديگر او نيست!
او رفت و به گمانم قسمتي از موسيقي را با خود برد، او رفت كه شايد در دنياي ديگر دغدغه ي خواندن و نخواندن، گفتن و نگفتن را نداشته باشد.
و حالا ما مي دانيم كه خيلي ديرتر از آنچه كه بايد، به او رسيديم و او را در ميان دنيايي از تيرگي ها به دست فراموشي سپرديم.

ديگر از افسوس براي رفته ها و گذشته ها براي ما سودي نخواهد داشت.
از چاله هاي پوك افسوس"
Shayea,"MohammadReza Shayea (In Persian شایع)
Rapper From Tehran, Born on 31 July 1992
MohammadReza said that everything about himself in the song ""Parvardgareh Ghalam"" and ""Ye Rooze Khoob Miad"" Said..."
Vigen,"Vigen Derderian (in other spellings: Viguen, Persian: ویگن) (November 23, 1929 - October 26, 2003), known as ""Sultan of Persian Pop"" and ""Sultan of Persian jazz"", was a hugely popular Armenian-Iranian pop music singer. He is famous throughout the Near East.
Born into a relatively poor family of 8 children in city of Hamadān, Iran. Vigen was brought up by his older brother, after his father died when he was seven. During the second world war, his family moved to the northern city of Tabriz then under invasion of the soviet army. He bought his first guitar from a soviet soldier. Later on he was widely listening to Italian and Spanish singers and using and modifying their music to perform with Persian lyrics. His brother Karo Derderian was a poet, the Lalaee (Lullaby) lyrics were written by him.
By 1951, Vigen had got his first job, performing at the Café Shemiran. One night, a national radio producer heard him, with the result that his first song, Mahtab (Moonlight), was broadcast on Tehran radio - and became an instant hit. More than 600 songs were to follow during his long career. Some of them, such as Gole sorkh (Red Rose), Raghib (Rival) and Dele Divaneh (Crazy Heart), have become classic Iranian popular songs.
In that era, every Iranian artist wanted to be associated with him, among them the country's most established top female singers, Delkash, Pouran and Elaheh. The legendary Vigen Derderian worked with the best Iranian songwriters and composers, who realised they had to cater for a new youth market, and performed some of his country's most memorable songs.

Before the emergence in the early 1950s of Vigen Derderian, the music industry of his native Iran was dominated by traditional singers, who had little knowledge of western pop music or such instruments as the guitar. Then Vigen, known as the ""Sultan of pop"", ushered in a revolution that coincided with the emergence of a new, western-influenced middle class.
Compared by some fans to Elvis Presley, Vigen's good looks and tall, fine physique added to his appeal as Iran's first male pop star - especially among women at a time when ideas of emancipation were taking hold in the 1950s and 60s. He was also one of the first Iranian entertainers to perform with a guitar. 

Vigen died at the age of 73 on October 26, 2003 from cancer in exile and is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Cemetery in Westlake Village, California"
Siamak Abbasi,"Siamak Abbasi (Persian : سیامک عباسی)  born in Tehran, Iran.
Short info : 
Graduate of ""Music"" And ""Cultural management"" / Poet, Composer, Arranger & Singer / Teaching ""Electronic Music"" & ""Technology of Music"" in the Iranian University of Applied Science (UAST)

Tehran is where I was born into a literary family; with a poet for a father. I lived in an air of music and poetry as a child. Throughout my student life, I was known to have a very good ear for music. My very aural taste which directly influences the creation of my work was shaped into existence during this period precisely. As a young adult I would wander about in the world of poetry and delve i nto it; quite soon, on this path, I stumbled upon my own style and that was when I started composing poetry. In the early years of high school, through a friend of mine, I got to know the guitar and soon after I started playing in ""blended music"" groups.
Upon entering music university and learning music academically, I also started working in professional studios as a recording artist. As well as that I followed electronic music in particular professionally and practically and I now teach this subject in the Iranian University of Applied Science (UAST).
After I graduated in Music, because ""culture"" and its surroundings had always been of certain interest and importance to me, I started studying Cultural Management; a major which includes all my favorite subjects: Literature, Music, Sociology, Media, ""Audience Studies"" etc. My work as a musician involves composing poetry and music, arrangement and singing. Currently I'm busy with the production of my debut album and soon it will be released.

""فارغ التحصیل رشته های ""موسیقی"" و ""مدیریت فرهنگی""
ترانه سرا، آهنگساز، تنظیم کننده و خواننده
مدرس دروس ""موسیقی الکترونیک"" و ""تکنولوژی موسیقی"" در دانشگاه علمی-کاربردی ایران"
Mehdi Yarrahi,"Mehdi Yarrahi (Persian : مهدی یراحی) was born in Ahvaz (Iran) on Nov 20 1981.He got interested in music composition between the ages of 10 and 13
while participating in Quran reading contests,during which time he was attracted to the inner music of verses and the words inside the Quran.
Later,he spent his years at guidance school as he made off and on attempts,honest attempts,at entering the world of music.Passing a period of theoretical studies under the supervision of Ali Kasraee, who was his only music teacher, was a beginning for him to pursue his interest more intently.
He has also learned to play guitar and the piano completely experimentally,and is now very good with them.
in 1379 he decides to permanently move to the Theran,the year in which he creates the album ""Hejrat"".later on,on account of having strictly persisted in presenting on influential and satistactory collection of his works,and because of some problems such as not obtaining a license from the ministry of islamic culture and guidance,he never got the chance to appear in legally permitted music gatherings and is forever unheard of.
Similar events occur to his nea albums in 1381 & 1383.
However his meticulousness and opinion based on respecting the audio intelligence of his audience-as opposed to the current norm-caus him to experience a more valuable style in pop; a style consisting in the value of the song and a more emotional combination of words with notes.
Eventually,in the winter of 1385 he tries to release a collection of his best works for the album ""Mano Raha Kon"" (Set Me Free) , an album which after three ears & in the year 1389 is completed so that we anticipate it`s production in near future.


A few words not yet said about Mehdi Yarrahi:
1.He mentions his mother as the first person who encouraged his presence in music and he also enjoyed his father`s support along the way.
2.For a better perception of the melody of composition,he`s been a foloower of simplicity.He says that melodies are heard in the crossing of the works and the personal emotions of the composer come to life.He also states he makes most of hisd melodies on the basis of the song;he sometimes recommends song writing on the bases of his melody to the songwriter.
3.As a matter that is so effective on his compositions,he mentions the song ""the wall"" which was presented by PinkFloyd,in particular the album and he says that he enjoyes the works od the music myth,Vangelis.He believes that Vangelis offet the music in simple but deep meaning.
4.He always pities the poor performances of some of the singers that helped them by composing and arrangement.
5.He likes the voices of Mohammadreza Shajarian,Farhad Mehrad,Ebrahim Hamedi,Dariush Eghbali,Moeen,Fereydoon Foroughi and late Hayede.He also adds the name of two of the best Arab singers,Omme kolsum and Abdol Halim Hafez.
6.With much regard to all of those who cooperated with him,he believes that the song of Roozbeh Bemaani is the sole song refrence of contemporary time of iran since the 135 Islamic Revelution and he also says that Roozbeh Bemaani is the repetition of the magneficence and position of Shaamloo in arena of songwriting.
7.Long years ago he showed interest in directing and has had consistency up to high levels of script writing.
8.Reading is a part of his inevitable activities and two of his most prefered books are those of Dr.Ali Shariati`s and Paulo Koeljo.
9.Michael Jakson,George Michael,Whitney Huston,Christana Aguilera and Sting are his favorite singer of the west and as for cinema,he admires the acting power of Al Pacino,Charlize Therin and monica Bellucci.

مهدی یرٌاحی ، بیست و سوم آبان ماه یک هزار و سیصد و شصت در شهر اهواز متولد شد .

علاقه اش به آهنگسازی زمانی شکل گرفت که بین سال های 10 تا 13 سالگی ضمن شرکت در مسابقات تلاوت قرآن ، نا خودآگاه مجذوب موسیقی درونی آیه ها و آهنگ چینش کلمات بود .

بعدها ، دوران تحصیل در مقطع راهنمائی را همراه با دوست و هم کلاسی اش بهزاد رئیسی _ که تنظیم برخی از آثارش را بر عهده داشته است _ در حالی سپری می کند که تلاش های جسته و گریخته اما صادقانه ای دارد برای حضور در دنیای موسیقی ، با این همه طی کردن دوره ی آموزش تئوری تحت نظر علی کسرائی که تنها معلم موسیقی اش بود ، سرآغازی می شود تا علاقه اش را به صورت جدی تری پیگیری کند ؛

وی هم چنان نواختن سازهای گیتار و پیانو را کاملا” تجربی فراگرفته و در نوازنده گی آنها مسلط است .

 

در سال 1379 تصمیم می گیرد تا برای همیشه به پایتخت نقل مکان کند ، سالی که هم زمان می شود با خلقت آلبوم هجرت که بعدها به خاطر سخت گیری های شخصی اش برای ارائه دادن یک مجموعه ی مطلوب و تاثیر گذار از آثارش و بروز برخی مشکلات از جمله عدم اخذ مجوز از وزارت فرهنگ و ارشاد اسلامی وقت ، هرگز فرصت حضور در بازار موسیقی مجاز را پیدا نمی کند و برای همیشه نشنیده باقی می ماند ؛

اتفاقی که در سال 1381 و 1383 نیز مشابها” برای آلبوم های تازه اش رخ می دهد کما اینکه وسواس و عقیده اش مبنی بر احترام گذاشتن به شعور شنیداری مخاطب _ بر خلاف جریان عرف _ باعث می شود سبک ارزشمند تری از موسیقی پاپ را تجربه کند ، سبکی مبتنی بر ارزش ترانه و تلفیق احساسی تر کلمات با نت ها … ؛

سر انجام در زمستان یک هزار و سیصد و هشتاد و پنج تلاش می کند تا مجوعه ای از بهترین آثارش را برای آلبوم من ُ رها کن آماده کند ، آلبومی که بعد از گذشت سه سال و در سال 1389 به اتمام می رسد تا به زودی شاهد انتشارش باشیم … ؛

ناگفته هائی از مهدی یرٌاحی:

از مادرش به عنوان اولین حامی حضورش در موسیقی نام می برد و در ادامه ی راه از حمایت های پدر نیز بهره مند بوده است .

برای درک بهتر ملودی ساختن ، به سادگی پایبند بوده است . می گوید ملودی ها معمولا” در تلاقی آثار شنیده شده و احساسات شخصی آهنگساز جان می گیرند و با اینکه ، اکثر ملودی هایش را بر اساس ترانه می سازد ، گاهی اوقات ترانه نویسی بر اساس ملودی اش را نیز به ترانه سرا پیشنهاد می دهد .

از موسیقی ارائه شده توسط گروه پینک فلوید به خصوص آلبوم the wall به عنوان جریانی به شدت تاثیر گذار بر آهنگسازی اش یاد می کند و از آثار ونجلیز که اسطوره ی ملودی سازی اش است به شدت لذت می برد . اعتقاد دارد که ونجلیز ، موسیقی را با زبانی ساده اما بسیار عمیق عرضه می کند .

به خاطر اجرای نه چندان خوب برخی آثارش توسط خواننده هایی که در زمینه ی آهنگسازی و تنظیم همراهی شان کرده ، همیشه افسوس می خورد .

آوای استاد محمدرضا شجریان ، فرهاد مهراد ، ابراهیم حامدی ، داریوش اقبالی ، معین ، فریدون فروغی و مرحوم هایده را بسیار می پسندد ، هم چنین ام کلثوم و عبدالحلیم حافظ را که از بزرگترین خوانندگان موسیقی عرب هستند .

با احترام به تمام ترانه سرایانی که با او همکاری کرده اند ، ترانه ی روزبه بمانی را تنها رفرنس ترانه ی معاصر ایران بعد از انقلاب اسلامی 1357 می داند و معتقد است که روزبه بمانی ، تکرار عظمت و جایگاه شاملو است در عرصه ی ترانه نویسی .

در سال های دور به رشته ی کارگردانی علاقه مند بوده و هم چنین فیلم نامه نویسی را تا سطوح بالا پیگیری کرده است .

مطالعه کردن ، بخش اجتناب ناپذیر برنامه هایش را تشکیل می دهد و آثار دکتر علی شریعتی و پائولو کوئلیو از کتاب های محبوبش هستند .

مایکل جکسون ، جرج مایکل ، ویتنی هیوستون ، کریستینا آگویلرا و استینگ خوانندگان مورد علاقه ی او در دنیای موسیقی غرب هستند و هم چنین در سینما ، قدرت بازیگری ال پاچینو ، چارلیز ترون و مونیکا بلوچی را بسیار می پسندد ."
Sogand,"Sogand Soheili (Persian: سوگند سهیلی; born August 13, 1987) is an Iranian singer. She is better known by her first name Sogand.
Sogand was born in Isfahan, Iran in 1987 and moved to Germany when she was 5 and has been living there ever since. At 17 she formed the duo “Entegham” with Farinaz, after a while, she separated from the duo and continue to her work as a successful female singer. She speaks Persian, German and English."
Xaniar,"Xaniar Khosravi (Born in 1986 in Tehran, Iran) is an Iranian Pop/Hip Hop singer, composer, lyricist and actor. He began pursuing music at about the age of 7 at the same time as his older brother Sirvan, who is also a popular singer. For a while he had left music to play soccer in semi-professional teams only to leave that too when he took an entry exam to study Law in college. He composed his first lyrics for Sirvan’s album. His songs are a nice balance between freshness and easy-listening with love and relationships as their subject matter and beautiful melodies. Risk, Dar Kenare Mahtab (Beside Luna Light), Bedoone To (Without You), and Oon (She) are among his most popular songs. Recently he has played in a movie by Peiman Moadi, Barf Ruye Kajha (Snow on Pines) but he stresses that his musical career is of top priority to him. 

Xaniar's voice is a smooth baritone and all of his songs are melodic with an extremely catchy tone. Despite the fact that none of his songs are remotely political or contain any profanity or vulgar themes that would run against the Islamic regulations of Iran, he has been considered an underground musician for 6 years until the Department of Arts finally granted him a licence to legally publish and sell his works on 24 December, 2013. His artistic genius and charming personality, however, have been able to draw in a lot of devoted fans, turning him into an iconic pop star despite all the limitations he had to tackle as an underground artist. 

Zendegie Hame Hamine (Everybody's Life's the Same) entered Holand's Funx Radio's Top 30 chart in October 2012. Also, together with his brother Sirvan, he has worked on a remix of one of Enrique Iglesias's songs, Stay Here Tonight, which awaits release. 

Bedoone To has recently surpassed 1 million plays on RadioJavan, and entered its top 10 songs of all time. His newly released single Omid Daram Hanuz (I Still Have Faith) reached 300,000 plays within two days and became the top song of the week.

Martik,"مارتيک, آبان ماه سال ۱۳۲۱ در آبادان متولد شد و در سن ۱۶ سالگي عازم تهران شد و فعاليت خود را با خواندن ترانه هاي خارجي آغاز نمود.

همه چيز از برنامه ي اول او با نواختن گيتار در گروه سل همراه گوگوش در کنسرتي در برج ايفل پاريس بود. مارتيک بعد ها ترانه ي چلچله را براي شماعي زاده, که خود نيز از آهنگ سازان مشهور آن زمان بود, ساخت تا شماعي زاده براي تشکر از زحمات او آهنگي ديگر را به مارتيک هديه دهد.

مارتيک به تشويق دوستانش که پيشنهاد خوانندگي را به او ميدادند, به طرف خوانندگي کشيده شد و با اولين ترانه ي خود با عنوان حرير که مورد استقبال مردم شد, خوانندگي را بيش از پيش جدي تر دنبال کرد.

Aref,"Aref (Aref Arefkia) was born in Tehran, Iran on August 10, 1941 and was one of the first Iranian pop artists of his time. Aref’s introduction to music came in part by his azari mother and by listening to Radio Baku as a child. Radio Baku played exceptional azari and western music as well as all the famous European operas.

At a time when the only kind of popular music was in ""Tasnif"" style, Aref introduced Western melodies with romantic lyrics to Iran in the 1960's. Aref was one of the pioneers of this trend. This style was quite popular among the youth, so much that at the age of 21 he was invited to appeare and sing on the Iranian National Television.

Aref's first TV appearance was with an Assyrian-Iranian girl named ""Narmela"". The two performed many duets, most notably ""Haft Asemoon"". Aref later sang in other duets with Pooran, Elaheh, Hayedeh, Delkash and also Ramesh. Aref and Hayedeh's song ""Vaghti to hasti, asemoon por az noore"" is one of the most beautiful songs left from that period.

His first hit was ""Daryacheye Noor"" which is still popular among all the Iranians. Aref was also a very popular singer for movie soundtracks. His songs were heard on numerous Iranian films of the 1960's & early 1970's among which ""Gholam Gandarm"" and ""Soltan-e Ghalbha"" are the most famous. He also appeared in six different musical films.

His success continued well into the mid 1970's. This is evident when one looks at the pop magazines of the time. In a survey conducted by Javanan Magazine Aref and Googoosh were both chosen as ""Most Famous Pop Icon"" of the year, 7 years in a row. Zan-e Rooz magazine also chose Aref as the MAN OF THE YEAR in which Aref among many other politicians, singers and actors (basically all famous men of Iran except Shah) were nominated.

Aref received many awards, one of which was granted to him by the Shah himself. Aref received the Highest Cultural Imperial Medallion from the Shah for singing at the Asian Games of 1974 in Iran. In this concert with Tehran's Philharmonic Orchestra, Aref sang in front of 100,000 Iranians and in the presence of many International state officials and dignitaries. Aref performed his first concert out of Iran in New York City in Madison Square to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the American Independence. 

Although the majority of his songs were of a more romantic nature, Aref’s collaborations with lyricist Iraj Janati Ataie did run Aref into problems with censorship. A few of his songs were not released and others had to be changed to get a distribution permit from the government. Some of those songs were ""Hame Ja Gham"", ""Hizom-e Nime Nime"" and ""Prandey-e Mohajer"" all of which had indirect political and social messages.

Aref and his family left Iran in 1979, following the Islamic revolution. He first lived in London for a period of 3 years, then moved to Los Angeles. Aref has three daughters and one son.

In recent years Aref has become active in other areas of Iranian music including traditional, classical, as well as the Los Angeles produced Iranian pop music. In 1996 with the help of his wife, Aref decided to start his own music distribution company, Rfaye, which has released most of his albums as well as other legendary compilations of Hayideh, Maziar, and other distinguished Iranian singers and musicians.

Aref recalls to have sung up to 500 songs to this date. In Los Angeles he produced many albums among which ""Mah va Palang"", ""Roozegar Gharibist Nazanin"", ""Ayineh dar Ayineh"" and another album, which is called Soltan-e Ghalbha has eleven of Aref's old hits that were all re-mastered.

Some of those songs are: ""Hame Chim Yaar"", ""Behtarin Bahaneh"", ""Yar-e Ke Boodi"", ""Ghasr-e Sadaf"", ""Cheshman-e To"", ""Gol-e Shoore Zaar"", ""Soltan-e Ghalbha"", ""Na Mehraboon"", ""Bagh-e Baroon Zadeh"", ""Gonahat ra nemibakhsham"" and ""Nasihat""."

Abjeez,"abjee (aab.gee)

Persian slang for sister ... and that’s just what they are - Safoura and Melody Safavi.

Backed by a colorful crew of musicians, the two abjee’s present their own original brand of Persian world pop!

Their lyrics, often humorous and sometimes rebellious, are written in Persian, but the expressive groove of the music and the abjees’ dramatic delivery break down all language barriers to create a new synthesis of cultures.
 
Perhaps ""world pop"" best describes Abjeez music. The Abjeez unique
sound is influenced by wide mixture of world compositions mastered to
its' own description of original melody and songs. Abjeez music is
suited for everyone regardless of age, sex or cultural backgrounds. The
lashing passion behind Abjeez force is to award love, carry hope and
perhaps become a diverse musical alternative for future generations in Iran. The Abjeez are sisters Safoura and Melody Safavi, backed by a colorful group of musicians from Sweden.

The Abjeez sisters, Safoura and Melody were born in Iran amongst a family of diverse musicians. Both sisters moved to Sweden along with their family in 1987. Looking up to their father’s passion for music combined with older brother Sufi’s love for guitar encouraged the sisters to start writing, and composing original music.

Having experienced living life in countries such as India, Sweden, Norway, England, Spain and United States has also had a great impact and influence on Abjeez music.

Safoura, the younger abjee, not only composes all their songs, but she has also been playing guitar and composing music since age 12. By 17 Safoura began studying music at Hvitfeldska Schol of music in Gothenburg/Sweden, and furthered her studies in the field of Flamenco guitar and song at the prestigious Fundacion Christina Heeren del arte flamenco, located in Seville/Spain.

After returning from Spain, Safoura decided to pursue a music project with her elder sister, which had already started 10 years before.

Safoura carefully handpicked the other four band members, describing them as a “musical goldmine.” Erland Hofgaard a skilled bassist and Paulo Murga a professional Chilean percussionist were introduced to Safoura several years back, while she was visiting Pitea University of Music during her brother’s studies for sound engineering. Both Erland and Paulo gave Safoura a great sense of musical approval by assuring her guaranteed collaboration with the Abjeez.

Flamenco guitarist Johan Moberg and drummer Robin Cochrane, were also discovered by Safoura years later in their home town of Ostersund/ Sweden.

Sufi, Safoura, Robin and Johan, who currently live in Ostersund have made the small town in to their own musical Mekka for creation and recording. Even though half of the Abjeez live far from each other, they often meet in Ostersund to catch up with practice and hit the road for performances from Europe to USA."

She went on to acquire her own solo programme, Golhaye Sahraii (Flowers of the Desert), presenting a collection of folk songs and music from various regions of Iran, which is still remembered today.
After graduating from Tehran University in 1969, majoring in Fine Arts, Sima Bina contniued and perfected her knowledge of radif with the highly subtle teaching of great Master Davami.

Since 1979, along with teaching Iranian classical music and vocality to selected students, Sima Bina has focused on doing further research on Persian folk songs, collecting, recording, writing and re-interpreting popular regional music, especially from Khorasan, her native land. By travelling to most remote places all over Khorasan, Sima has been able to gather and revive a collection of almost forgotten songs and melodies. She has thus gained a unique position in the history of Persian music.

Since 1993, Sima Bina has been invited to present her collection of Persian folk songs in festivals all over the world, including ´97 Världen I Norden in Norway, ´99 WDR Weltmusik Festival in Bonn/Germany, and the forthcoming Raza Festival on Khorasan Music in the Netherlands. Furthermore she was invited to perform on “emociona!!! Mujer” in Spain in 2001, then also in Cologne/Germany on the “World Music Night” and also on a Festival in Antwerpen/Netherlands in the “Culturen Centrum”. And many many more.

Due to her devotion and dedication to the Iranian folk music, Sima Bina can now see the materialization of thirty years of meticulous work by making her music known worldwide."

While in the midst of a hectic touring schedule with our group Niyaz, my husband/musical collaborator Loga Ramin Torkian and I began to feel the need to create something that would allow us a world to lose ourselves into, a place of solace that could unburden us from the pressures that come from expectations placed on us as artists. Though tremendously grateful for the opportunity we had to perform our music in parts of the world we never imagined visiting, the physical demand of traveling, performing and being full time parents to our beautiful, magical little son Iman whom we refused to leave behind, took its expected toll on us. So in the quiet months back in our own home, we began creating this world for ourselves to escape into- a world where no expectations exist, a world where it sufficed just to be. As with all journeys, the unexpected happened along the way, and we slowly found ourselves discovering new plateaus of sonic landscapes which we would have never encountered had we not fully embraced the terrifying silence which comes with turning within. Hence, Lamentation of Swans became for us a Journey Towards Silence."""

Shahab’s first US project ""Tapesh"" was born a short while later. The band started to perform at local events in Arizona.

She released two mesmerizing EPs in January 2007: 'Morning' and 'Paratrooper' -- and spent the year touring across the country and in Europe, at venues such as the Bonnaroo Festival, SXSW, and the Mimi Festival in France. She performed at David Byrne's Nonesuch-sponsored series at Carnegie Hall, recorded with Sean Lennon (on 'Before the Skies'), and shared the stage with such diverse artists as the legendary Hugh Masakela and Odetta.

While back at home from touring, Haale and producer/percussionist Matt
Kilmer went to work on their first full-length debut, 'No Ceiling.' It was released on March 18, 2008, to critical acclaim, hailed ""one of the year's most memorable releases,"" by the Boston Globe. The album features players Shahzad Ismaily, Mike Gamble, Doug Wieselman, Chris Hoffman, and Johnny Gandlesman and co-writing by Matt Kilmer and Dougie Bowne.

On the breathtaking full-length debut, ""No Ceiling"" Haale explores themes of transformation and evolution, singing in English and Persian through a riveting soundscape of percussion, psychedelic guitars, and soaring strings.

'Over driving rhythms...Haale's warm, supple voice unfurled like a curlicue of smoke. Her band's amplified rumble served as a reminder of the extent to which rock bands like the Doors and the Velvet Underground turned to the East for their hypnotic efforts; here their borrowings were reclaimed with interest.'
-NEW YORK TIMES

'Haale is just beginning to make her mark nationally, but she's a star on the rise. [Their] raw sound owes as much to '60s psychedelic rock as it does to the ancient Middle East...'
-WASHINGTON POST

'On her two latest EP releases, 'Paratrooper' and'Morning' (both self-releasd), [Haale] works a panoramic blend of luscious rock, heady bass, and brilliantly produced rhythms.'

Javad Maroufi,"Javād Ma'roufi (Persian: جواد معروفی) (b. 1912 — d. December 7, 1993, Tehran, Iran), was a celebrated ethnic Persian (Iranian) composer and pianist. He was one of the first musicians who chose to perform Persian music on the piano.
Javād Ma'roufi was born in Tehran to the musician father Musā Ma'roufi and mother Ozrā Ma'roufi who both were distinguished pupils of Darvish Khan, a renowned music master of the time in Iran. Javād Ma'roufi lost his mother at young age, and consequently grew up in his paternal family. He was taught in music first by his father, playing both the tar and the violin. At fourteen he attended the Academy of Music of which Ali-Naqi Vaziri was the director and where he studied the piano under the music master Tatiana Kharatian. During this period he studied works by Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. In addition to studying western classical music, he studied Persian classical music under Ali Naqi Vaziri.
Ma'roufi graduated from Vaziri’s School of Music  in 1932. He went on to receive a diploma from the  Tehran Conservatory, where he studied Western music. He believed that, in order to be able to play Persian music on the piano, one should also master the techniques of Western music. 
Ma'roufi began working at Radio Iran when it was established in 1941. He collaborated closely with the great Rouhollah Khaleghi as a piano soloist, as well as an arranger of works of other composers. He taught piano, music theory, and solfege at the School of  National  Music for  many  years. He also composed many original works for piano solo. 
Javād Ma'roufi was one of the most notable composers of the Persian classical music and one of the first pianists who wrote Persian pieces for the piano. Amongst his celebrated pieces are Khābhā-ye Talā'i (Golden Dreams) and Jilā.

Javād Ma'roufi married at eighteen with Shams Zamān. They had four children, two daughters Sho'kooh-Zamān(Giti), and Jilā, and two sons, Manouchehr, and Farhād.
Javād Ma'roufi died in the morning of Tuesday 7 December 1993 (16 Āzar 1372 AH) in a hospital in Tehran.

Faramarz Payvar,"Farāmarz Pāyvar (Persian: فرامرز پایور) (February 10, 1932, Tehran – December 9, 2009, Tehran) was an Iranian santur player, composer and Ostad (master) of Persian traditional music.
Pāyvar was born in Tehran, Iran, into an aristocratic and musical family, which was also famous for serving the court. His grandfather, Moìavaroldoleh, was a renowned painter in the court of Nāseraldin Shah. He also, was a fine musician and played the violin, the Setar and the Santur. His father, Ali Pāyvar, was both a painter and Professor of French at the University of Tehran. Pāyvar's mother was also interested in the arts in general and music in particular. She was aware of her son's talent and encouraged him to play the instrument.
Pāyvar started to demonstrate his musical talent in his earlier years and he gradually realised that he wanted to become a musician and an artist. At the age of seventeen, when he finished his studies at Dārolfonūn High School, he began his musical career, studying with Abolhasan Saba. He studied the Radif repertory and played the santur with Sabā for eight years before he graduated from his master class.

Pāyvar was highly skilled on the santur and soon became very famous. After Sabā's death he began to study with four other masters: Nour Ali Boroumand, Roknoldin Mokhtāri, Abdollah Davami, and Haji Āqā Mohamad Irani. Pāyvar began his co-operation with the Iranian Department of Art and Culture in 1954, and established an orchestra called ""The Art and Culture Orchestra"" in that department. He invited famous musicians to join, including Hossein Tehrani (tonbak), Khàtere Parvàneh (traditional singing), Houshang Zarif (tar), Mohammad Reza Shajarian (singer), Rahmatolàh Badiee (kamānčeh), and Abdolvahab Shahidi (singer).

In 1958, Pāyvar began to teach the santur at The National Music Conservatory. Four years later, in 1962, he received a scholarship from the Department in which he was teaching, and went to England to study English. He graduated with a Graduate Diploma in English from Cambridge University in 1965. At the same time he studied Western music at the Royal Academy of Music in London, and there he lectured on Iranian music and also made some recordings, which are heard nowadays on BBC radio programmes in the Persian language.
Pāyvar has performed in many countries, including the USA, Germany, England, Sweden, France, Japan, Italy, Malaysia, and Russia, and is known around the world as a santur virtuoso and composer.

Pāyvar died on December 9, 2009 after a long struggle with brain damage."
Taham,"TAHAM is an Iranian music producer, Songwriter , Rapper and singer.He was born in Tehran/Iran in 1988. He started as a rapper and in a few years turned into a Record producer. He has been active in the music industry for almost 8 years. He is the first composer that fused the Iranian 6/8 time signature with elements of hiphop and made major hits like ""Mano doost daran""....The production of his first official album titled ""Commercial songs (taranehaye bazargani)""got finished in late 2009 and will be released soon."
Massoud Shaari,"Massoud Shaari was born in 1961 in Tehran , Iran.

From the very childhood, he was deeply attached to Iranian music and started learning Santur at the age of thirteen, taught by the lost artist Manijeh Alipour.  After a while, he turned to learn Setar, monitored by Dariush Tala'i and has continued playing it ever since. In 1982, he begun learning Tar, taught by Mohammad Reza Lotfi, through  whom he became acquainted with the art of Iranian traditional music systems (Radif) and its mysteries. In the meantime, he was honored to be trained by master Ali Asghar Bahari and spent a while playing old pieces with him.

Great interest in Setar lead him to Hossein Alizâdeh, and in fact his artistic promotion is indebted to this valuable master of Iranian music. As to the fact that, in his childhood, he had also been trained by some outstanding masters such as Saeed Hormozi and Yusef Forutan, managed to become fully familiar and accustomed to Iranian classical music and discovered its delicacies and beauties. Shaari has always tried to reconstruct the works of the pioneer masters of music and this high goal resulted in creation of two albums, ""Shabahang"" and ""Karevan E Saba"".
In Shabahang we can see improvisation in Radif (Iranian traditional  music systems), and also reconstruction the works of some masters as Roknneddin Mokhtary, Abolhasan Saba, Saeed Hormozi, and Yusef Forutan. In Karevan E Saba, the chief goal is interpretation of some pieces of music for setar, originally composed by master Abolhasan Saba for violin.

Shaari has always endeavored to teach Iranian classical music and has been involved in Setar tuition since 1981 in art centers directed by private and public sectors. In this connection, he has trained many apprentices following his artistic school. Now, he teaches privately, as well as in Azad University, and artistic center of Kamkars Ensemble. He follows his special teaching method (which is under publish.)

Massoud Shaari, with his complete control over traditional Persian music, has tried to restore the almost forgotten melodies and rhythms of traditional Persian music, and confront it with contemporary music and modes of interpretation.

It seems that his insight of music is absolutely free, and he tries to restore the lost elements of Iranian music such as forgotten rhythms and melodies, and mix them with modern music.

For the past ten years, he has been teaching Setar and theory of traditional Persian music in different places: Azad University, “Kamkar” musical center, and in various other musical centers in the private and public sectors.

Hengameh,"Hengameh (Persian : هنگامه) was born in Lahijaan, Iran. Together with her parents and her older sister, she moved to Tehran at age three. Ever since childhood, she had a great passion for singing and performing. Hengameh’s father was first to detect this passion. The never ending love and support of her father that was quite evident from the very early stages of Hengameh’s life further motivated and encouraged her to take music lessons with some of the masters of Persian classical music. Being a proficient ney and flute player, Hengameh’s father believed that she should learn the Persian classical music modes, “Radif” and develop a strong theoretical foundation, as he himself was very much interested and knowledgeable in this genre of music.

Hengameh enjoyed the support of her family and friends, as she grew older. Throughout her school years, she participated in numerous local and regional talent contests and always managed to come first amongst her peers. She always dreamt of becoming a professional singer after finishing high school, but this dream could never be fulfilled for as long as the changes that were imposed by the new Islamic Republic government were there to stay. After finishing high school, Hengameh married and soon after, she gave birth to her only child, her daughter, but never stopped thinking about her life long dream of becoming a singer. Hengameh eventually realized that she had no choice but to leave her beloved homeland and migrate abroad if she was ever to pursue her dream.

In 1992, Hengameh moved to Vancouver, Canada with her husband and daughter. In Vancouver, she first met Ali Elahi (keyboard player), and Fereydoon (singer), and through them she was introduced to Kamran (singer), and Ramin Zamani (Song writer, producer). In 1995 Hengameh, Fereydoon, and Kamran started to work on a collaborative effort with Ramin Zamani. They produced their first single titled, “Iranam”, which was about to gain much popularity for the three singers in a very short period of time. Their popularity was now extended beyond Vancouver, and the larger Iranian population in Los Angeles was suddenly interested in their talent.

With further opportunities in the Los Angeles area, each singer began to pursue his/her individual careers. Although Hengameh was in touch with many producers, she remained loyal to Ramin Zamani who has had much influence on her music carrier. Her debut album, “Baray-e Didan-e To” was the result of a five years joint effort, which was cherished by millions across the world. This intense interest and loyal fan support paved the way for the release of a second album, “Artesh-e Solh”. The new album undoubtedly opened a new chapter in Hengameh’s singing carrier. A talent that was born years ago was now a dream come true. The tremendous love and support from her fans and the respect from the Iranian music society has reinforced the desire in Hengameh to press on and take steps in becoming part of a heritage, that of Iranian Music history."

Shahrokh,دهم آذر ماه ۱۳۳۲ در شهر تهران و در خانواده ای ایرانی ،هنر دوست و هنر پرور کودکی متولد شد که نام شاهرخ یکی از پادشاهان بزرگ سرزمین پارسیان را برای او برگزیدند.پدرش عیسی و مادرش نرگس نام داشت و نام خانوادگیش شاهید می بود.شاهرخ در سن ۷ سالگی فعالیت هنری خود را در برنامه کودک رادیو ایران واقع در میدان ارک آغاز نمود و کماکان در همان سالها به تشویق پدرش و توسط وی برای فراگیری ردیفهای موسیقی ایرانی در کلاس استاد مهرتاش به مدت ۱۰ سال شرکت نمود.لازم به ذکر میباشد که استاد مهرتاش تنها کسانی را نزد خود می پذیرفت که استعداد خواندن آواز ایرانی را میداشتند ،باری در کلاس آواز، استاد مهرتاش از یکی از هنر آموزانش که بزرگ و سرمشق کلاس نیزبود یعنی استاد محمد رضا شجریان می خواست تا گوشه ای از یک دستگاه را شروع کند تا کم کم به شاگردان کم سن و سالتر کلاس از جمله شاهرخ برسد .  شاهرخ در سن ۱۲ سالگی به استخدام تالار رودکی تهران و گروه کر ملی ایران که توسط آلفرد   مالرویان رهبری می شد و همچنین در اپرا مشغول به فعالیت هنری شد. شاهرخ در سن ۱۱ سالگی مادر جوان و مهربانش را در بستر بیماری از دست میدهد و سه سال بعد نیز پدر بزرگوارش نیز مرحوم می شود (روحشان قرین رحمت و شادی باد).شاهرخ در همان دوران نوجوانی در دامان خواهر نه چندان بزرگتر خود تربیت و پرورش یافت و از سن نوجوانی فراگیری نت و سلفژ را آغاز کرد و زیر نظر استاد پور تراب در هنرستان ملی موسیقی ایران آموزش دید همچنین به مدت ۵ سال زیر نظر استاد کازاتو که معلم لوچیانو پاوراتی خواننده معروف اوپرای جهان بودند آموزش اپرا دید .شاهرخ که یکی از سولیستهای موسیقی اپرا میباشد و صدای او نیز تنور باریتون (زیر یا نازک و بم یا کلفت) است قطعات بزرگ دنیا را توسط سلیستهای بزرگ دنیا که به ایران دعوت میشدند در فرهنگ و هنر اجرا کرد.شاهرخ در سن ۱۴ سالگی ترانه دوست دارم را به دنیای موسیقی پاپ ارائه داد که مورد تشویق و حمایت جوانان و مردم قرار گرفت ،نام دومین ترانه وی شبا بی تو و بعدی نیز راه بیفت نام داشت و در سریال غریبه ترانه ای به همین نام اجرا کرد که به مدت ۲ سال هر شب از شبکه یک صدا و سیما پخش می شد و بدین ترتیب با استقبال مردم از ترانه هایش ،وی در همان سنین جوانی به یکی از خوانندگان مطرح موسیقی ایران تبدیل شد.محل زندگی شاهرخ اطراف خیابان نواب و میدان محمد رضا شاه سابق یعنی شمال غربی تهران بود و در دبستان بامشاد و دبیرستان مروی تحصیل نمود و تحصیلات موسیقی خود را در تالار رودکی و تاتر جام باربد گذرانید و همینطور معلم خصوصی آواز نیز به منزلشان می آمد.وی در کنار تحصیل و فرا گیری آواز و موسیقی به ورزش بوکس نیز بسیار علاقه مند بود و به باشگاه بوکس نیز جهت تمرین در این رشته می رفت تا جائی که در سن ۱۸ سالگی در مسابقات بوکس قهرمانی کشور شرکت نمود و به دو دلیل که یکی نا داوری در مسابقات و دیگری تاثیر منفی ضربات این ورزش بر روی صدایشان ،این ورزش را ترک نمود.شاهرخ در سال 1975 جهت ادامه تحصیل موسیقی و فعالیت در ارکستر فلارمونیک شهرلس آنجلس به آمریکا مهاجرت کرد وی پس از زنده یاد ویگن دومین هنرمند آواز خوان مقیم لس آنجلس می بود (البته آقای ویگن به دلیل اختلافی که با خانواده سلطنتی داشتند به اجبار ترک وطن کرده بودند).شاهرخ در هنگام آغاز انقلاب در ایران ،به وطن باز میگردد تا در کنار خانواده خود باشد و شب قبل از ورود خمینی به ایران به آمریکا کوچ می کند و تا به امروز از دیدن وطن محروم میشود.شاهرخ هنرمند وطن پرست و آزادی خواه در شهر فرشتگان با گرفتاری فراوان کار حرفه ای خود یعنی موسیقی و آواز را دوباره ادامه میدهد و با گروه موسیقی اصیل ایرانی به نام عشاق آلبوم عشاق ۲ ،که از کارهای جاویدان عارف قزوینی می باشد را ارائه میدهد و بعد نیز آلبوم عتیقه ، من و تو ، عروسی ، ماه شب چهارده ، عروسک شکستنی ، لعبت ، آهو ، کاکلی ، خونه ، عریضه و چهار یا پنج آلبوم مشترک به همراهی هنرمندانی همچون ابی و شهرام و مسعود فردمنش به نامهای: هیچ کجا ایران نمیشه ، شاه گل ، حکایت چهارم و…. را ارائه میدهند همچنین دو آلبوم از ترانه هایی که در ایران خوانده بودند نیز به نامهای کولی و غروب را دوباره ارائه می دهد که بیشتر آهنکهای این آلبومها توسط شاهرخ ساخته شده است.شاهرخ در شهر فرشتگان ازدواج می کند و حاصل این ازدواج دختری زیبا بنام ملودی می باشد که وی نیز علارقم نوجوان بودنش به موسیقی علاقه مند است و نوازنده موفق یک  نوع ساز بادی می باشد، شاهرخ در اوایل ورودش به آمریکا به جهت ضبط آلبوم هایش تصمیم به تاسیس یک استودیو در محل زندگیش نمود که نام استودیو ملودی نام دارد و در حال حاضر مشغول ضبط آهنگهای چندین آلبوم میباشد از جمله آلبوم بسیار زیبای ترانه باران که به زودی ارائه خواهد شد.یکی از صداهای مورد علاقه شاهرخ در موسیقی اصیل ایرانی،صدای استاد شجریان و در موسیقی پاپ ،صدای شادروان فرهاد مهراد و  از فعالیتهای مورد علاقه شاهرخ تنظیم و ضبط موسیقی در استودیو و پرورش گل در حیاط منزلش میباشد.این تنها گوشه ای از بیوگرافی این هنرمند بزرگمان شاهرخ بود که بازگو شد
Khak,"Band
The band Khak (XAK) revolves around the singer, songwriter and guitarist Shahriar Khatam. 

Band History
In 1995 three Iranian musicians living in Germany founded the band ""Khak"": 

Shahriar Khatam (Vocals, Guitars) 
Afshin Tahmasebi (Keyboards, Guitars) 
Khodayar Bahmani (Drums) 
The guys had already known each other for a couple of years and had played together in other bands. 

Khak's primary goal was to change and improve contemporary Iranian music with a mature and elegant blend of Oriental and Western music (pop, rock) - making Khak a world music band. 

In 1998 Konstantinos Kostis, a Greek citizen who was raised and lives in Germany joined the band as a bassist. Now the band was complete. 

During the following years the band was very active and made music that raised many people's hopes and expectations. In 1999 the first album ""Ashegham Bash"" was recorded at Khak's own studio and released by Khak. 

The band headlined several gigs and played as support act for well established Iranian musicians such as Farrokhzad, Ebi, Moin, Shahram Shab-pareh, Noosh-afarin and earned recognition in the industry. 

Khak received offers and suggestions from people from the USA and other countries but the band was determined to make its own music. Khak stuck to their guns and did not follow shallow passing trends. 

Private matters effectively shut Khak down from early 2002 until early 2004. 

Now Khak is alive and kicking again:

New singles have been prepared for the new album (lyrics in Persian, German and English). Video Clips for the singles are also being filmed 
The band's homepage has been completely reworked and is updated more frequently 
Existing media contacts were intensified and new contacts have been established 
Khak works energetically and with high motivation to enter the international music scene 
Khak tries to represent Iran with dignity on international level. We rely on the support of our fans, friends and partners and everyone with a heart for people, life and music. 

Khak is not a person nor property. Khak is a movement! 

What does Khak mean?
Khak is a Persian word and has a number of meanings such as: dirt, dust, earth, ground, soil, territory. When we chose the name, we had ""soil"" in mind but also a number of properties associated with the Persian word Khak such as purity and generosity. Some people spell it differently like ""Xâk"" or ""Xaak"". Never mind. Things like that happen when you transcribe something using a different alphabet. 

Khak connects everyone across the globe, nourishes and protects us. Khak as a band is a musical combination of Western music and Persian, German and English lyrics, created by experienced musicians with broad and colorful musical roots. Their sheer love of the music is plain to see, and the result is music that appeals to everyone, not just Iranians or Germans. Music is, after all, a universal language.

Mamak Khadem,"Mamak Khadem is a singer. By nature, she is a nomad, one who thrives on open spaces. By occupation, she is a bridge, one that connects geography to lore. In music, she is open to cultural influences, but she has chosen the classical Persian style as her base. She was born in Iran, at a time when tides were changing. She was part of the Children's Choir for National Radio and Television of Iran, but it wasn't until the late 1970s and after the Iranian Revolution of 1979 that her passion for singing waxed. Inspired by works of master musicians in the 1980s, she seized every opportunity to further her vocal art, regularly traveling back to Iran to study with some of the finest Persian vocalists and masters. She benefited from classical Indian singing tradition at Ali Akbar Khan College of Music in northern California and from Bulgarian chore of  Nevenka   while exploring the traditional music of Greece, Turkey, and Armenia."

Jalil Shahnaz,"Jalil Shahnāz  (Persian: جلیل شهناز) (May 22, 1921, Isfahan, Iran - June 17, 2013, Tehran, Iran) was an Iranian classical musician and legendary tar player.

Jalil Shahnaz was born in the glorious and artsy city of Isfahan, Iran. His father had an eager interest in Persian traditional music and his house was a warm faculty to all traditional music lovers at that time. His other son, Hossein also played the tar charmingly professional. Jalil’s father was his main supporter in playing this original Persian musical instrument early on; therefore Jalil began practicing having his brother as tutor. It was almost at this time that Jalil, Hossein and the Tar became like intimate companions. Every time Hossein hugged the tar to play, Jalil was always near, watching his brother’s cunning hand like a manic lover yearning for his childhood fantasies and quenching his thirst upon it. The childhood period was done and there came the juvenile years. Every day as Jalil returned home from school, he went straight to his brother humbly asking him to play the tar and he was always welcomed by Hossein’s modest response as he taught him professionally.

After a while Jalil came to Tehran and found his way to the radio, gradually leading him to participate in various orchestras as well as the prominent radio program “Golha” (meaning Flowers, a popular musical radio show in the pre-Islamic-Revolution era of Iran) and became one of its major solo players at that time.
Aside from playing the tar as his professional instrument, Jalil Shanhnaz is also familiar with the violin, dulcimer and tombak (Persian goblet drum) and plays them enticingly. His solo works and specially “Golha's” are among the greatest musical works in Persian music.

Jalil Shahnaz has been accompanied by some of the authorities of persian traditional music such as Faramarz Payvar, Habibollah Badiee, Parviz Yahaghi, Homayoun Khorram, Ali Tajvidi, Mansour Saremi, Reza Varzandeh, Jahangir Malek, Asadollah Malek, Hassan Kasaei, Mohammad Mousavi, Jalal Taj Esfahani, Esmaeil Adib khansari, Mahmood Mahmoodi Khansari, Abdolvahab Shahidi, Akbar Golpayegani, Hossein Khajeh Amiri  and Mohammad Reza Shajarian.

Fereydoon Farrokhzad,"Fereydoon Farrokhzad (Persian: فریدون فرخزاد ) (October 7, 1936 - August 6, 1992) was an Iranian singer, actor, poet, TV and radio host, writer, and political opposition figure. He was the younger brother of the acclaimed Persian poet Forough Farrokhzad.

He was stabbed to death on 8th August 1992, at his home in Bonn, Germany, and was found three days later. The murder has been treated as a work of the Iranian government.

Fereydoon Farrokhzad was born in ""Chahar Raheh Gomrok"" (Gomrok Intersection), a neighborhood in Tehran, Iran. He was the second of seven children (Amir, Massoud, Mehrdad, Forough, Pouran, Gloria). After graduating from high school he went to Germany and Austria for his post-secondary education. He got his Ph.D. in political science from a university in Berlin. At a young age Farrokhzad had a passion for poetry and for singing. He turned that passion to reality in 1962 when he started writing poems in Germany, which were published in two German newspapers. In 1964 Farrokhzad published his collection of poems called ""Fasleh Deegar"" (Another Season). His book was critically acclaimed and was honored by many famous German poets. Five months after the release of ""Fasleh Deegar"" Farrokhzad received the Poetry Award of Berlin. For a couple years Farrokhzad was a member of the Munich Academy of Poetry.[citation needed] In 1966 he found his way to the Television and Radio of Munich. On Radio he had a comedy and music program which played middle eastern music including music from Iran. On TV he created and produced a show called خيابان های آلپ (Alpine Roads). In 1967 he returned to Iran and performed on successful radio and TV shows. His most successful and famous TV show was ""Mikhakeh Noghrei"" (Silver Carnation). The show was watched by millions of Iranians. On the show Farrokhzad introduced and discovered many famous Iranian artists including Sattar, Shohreh, Shahram Solati, Ebi, Morteza, Rouhi Savoji, Hamid Shabkhiz, Leila Forouhar, Saeed Mohammadi and many more.

Farrokhzad married twice and both marriages ended in failure. His first marriage took place in 1962, to a German woman named Ania Buchkowski, whom he met at Oxford. Like Farrokhzad, she had a passion for poetry and theater; it was after meeting her that Farrokhzad started writing poems. They divorced, but they had a son called Rostam. His second marriage, to an Iranian woman, also ended in divorce.

On August 6, 1992 Farrokhzad was stabbed 40 times with a knife at his home in Bonn, Germany. He was found three days later by his neighbor, his body lying in a pool of blood with his dog whimpering beside him. The murder has been treated as a work of the Iranian government intelligence service, because of Farrokhzad's anti-Islamic Republic remarks in his shows, which insulted Khomeini and other leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

His songs are still played on Iranian TV and Radio shows outside of Iran. Many artists like Saeed Mohammadi and Shahram Shabpareh have done covers of his famous songs. He is responsible for the success of many Iranian artist that are famous today. Singer Ebi has said that he owes his success to Farrokhzad. He was known by his fans to be an educated patriot who spoke out against the Islamic Republic."

Elaheh,"Bahar Gholamhosseini, better known by her stage name Elaheh (Persian: الهه; born 1934, Yazd, Iran, died August 15, 2007, Tehran, Iran) was one of the best known female vocalists in Iran before the 1979 revolution. Her singing career spanned more than half a century and included several performances for the popular National Radio programme Golha, which was host to many highly esteemed Iranian vocalists. During this time she collaborated with famous Iranian composers and soloists, and the fruits of these collaborations include some of the most popular songs in Persian classical music. She also performed at the Albert Hall, London.

Her best-known songs works include Rosvayeh Zamaneh (Revealed to the World) and Az khoon-e Javanan-e Vatan Laleh Damideh (Tulips grow from the blood of the country’s youth). Her songs were used in the first radio programme on air announcing the new republic. After the Islamic revolution, however, her singing career, like those of many other female singers, came to an abrupt end when female vocalists were banned from public performances. Elaheh then fled the country for the US, where she worked in Los Angeles during the 1980s and 1990s.

While living abroad Elaheh’s career took a controversial turn when she collaborated with the exiled group Mujahidin, which she later denounced as more of an “extremely narrow and strict cult” than an intellectual organisation of freedom fighters.

In an interview with Anne Singleton in September 2005, Elaheh stated that she was lured into collaboration with the Mujahidin through one of its satellite organisations based in Europe. She describes how she was stuck in that situation for several years, unable to perform freely while the Mujahidin failed to meet its full financial commitments to her. Elaheh finally denounced the organisation in 2003 and returned to Iran three months ago where she died of cancer.

Elaheh’s legacy is her much-loved voice and songs which many people, old and young alike, still remember and sing. Last week the National Radio aired a one-hour programme of her songs; it was the first show to feature a female singer in 27 years. And she is to be recognised in Iran for her contribution to music. Elaheh once stated: “What I am sure of is that my legacy is my voice and that for years to come people will enjoy my voice and my songs. These belong to Iran and the world of music.”

She was married three times; two husbands survive her as well as four sons and one daughter."

1- Early life:

Homeyra was born 1945 to an aristocratic Iranian family in East Iran. Her family’s distinction is still evident as the name of Amir-Afshari is, to this day among eastern Iranians, synonymous with affluence. Her father was a Malek (Grand Landlord) who owned over 150 towns in Iran. Her family's eminence was later to be an opposing factor in Homeyra's passion for singing.

She was exposed to Persian music from an early age. Her family often hosted large dinner parties to which Iran's greatest musicians and singers were invited for guest entertainment. Revering other musicians and singers, the young novice became interested in singing. Her father took notice of this and diligently curtailed her exposure further. He also forbade her from performing in presence of non-family members and insisted if she must sing, then she do so only for him. He and the matriarchs of the family saw her singing as a disgrace to the family's name.

At age 16, Homeyra married a German-educated Iranian businessman. He allowed her more freedom and encouraged her to sing professionally. So she took music lessons and also signed up for voice training courses. She secretly attended composer Ali Tajvidi's classes for two years, leading her father to believe she was learning to drive a motor vehicle.


2- Overnight fame:

Homeyra's leads pulled her into the Iranian music scene soon after her participation in musical lessons. While attending Tajvidi's classes, he composed a song for her and persuaded her to record it as a single for release. Despite her reservations, she agreed and when the song ""Sabram Ataa Kon"" was played on Iran's radio stations, she became an overnight sensation, and this at age 18. However, in order to disguise herself from the exposure, she chose Homeyra as the name to which this song was to be attributed. It was said this was a first for a debutante singer to gain such quick renown throughout Iran with just a hit single.

The enthusiastic record companies were soon to vie for the copyright to the song for wider distribution. When it was officially released in an album, Homeyra's father, recognizing her voice, tried a last minute effort to quell her career. He purchased every single album he could find – both legal and pirated copies – to remove the remnants of his daughter's voice from reach. However, some of the copies fell into the hands of loyal fans and he could not stop the furor of Homeyra's fame thereon. He has refused to speak to her ever since and the two became estranged.


3- Recent Events:

On August 22, 2009, Homeyra had a unique concert with Michael and Pouya in New York. After the presidential election 2009 in Iran, Homeyra sang the song ""Jahan Kharan"" for all Iranians suffering from the frauds around the elections. Therefore her fans call her ""golden stone in persian music"". In February 2010 Homeyra announced that she will start a good bye tour very soon called ""toure khodahafezi"". This tour will be placed in over 50 cities around the world. On March 6, 2010, she performed in Toronto and the concert was sold out. On youtube (Homeyra, Toronto) you can see how excited fans are when Homeyra comes to the stage. The last female singer of the ""great generation"" is loved by millions and with her unique voice she is one of the few guarantees for a high class level Persian music in our days. Her new album will be released in 2011.

Idin,"The young Persian-American artist merges Middle Eastern melodies and words along with Western influenced jazz, trance, and pop sounds to create an energized, powerful musical experience all of his own. Idin (Persian: آیدین) uses his phenomenal ""Voice"" as more than just a sound, but as an instrument unto itself that seamlessly blends the different musical influences to produce what is sure to develop into an entirely new genre of music. Idin is clearly the new ""Voice"" of his generation.

For Idin, music is not just something to listen to...""I don't just listen to a song, I breathe it, I live it. Music is my life energy and inspiration, just as my mother is to me, famous Persian singer, Shourangiz. I grew up in a household where music and singing was just as important as our daily meal, I couldn't, and still can't go through a single day without singing for a couple of hours. Some people cry when they're sad, some people go out and run when they're angry; I sing, I listen to music, I write lyrics and I create sounds."" -Idin

Born in Anaheim, California on March 8, 1984, Idin is still strongly influenced by his Persian heritage. When Avang Music gave Idin the chance to work on his own original album in 2003, Idin relished the opportunity. Since then, two successful albums have been released. ""The Voice"" released in the fall of 2004, which won Iran international recognition out of 26 countries at the Asian International Song Festival, in Goa, India, winning Iran first place with his hit song, ""Dooset Daram"". ""Guess"" released in the fall of 2006, which included hit songs such as ""Yadam Toro Faramoosh"", ""Hads Bezan"", ""Yeckie Nist"" and ""Iran"".

Eworldrecords.com, the largest online store for Middle Eastern music, states ""Idin is truly a unique and pioneering force in the Persian music industry."" Avang Music Co. continues to celebrate their young artists success and as quoted by the record label themselves in a widely respected Persian entertainment magazine known as ""Javanan"", it was stated: ""Idin is quite clearly the hope of Avang Music Company's future"".

""I thank and respect all the Persian singers who have helped keep Iran's music alive to date, and allowed young singers like myself, with a new spin on Persian music, to express ourselves and take Persian music to a new generation. My goal is to create music that all cultures and nationalities can listen to and enjoy regardless of the language barrier. In my opinion good music doesn't have to be in a language you understand, it simply has to move you and emotionally touch you. My music may not be for anyone, or it might be for everyone...time will tell."" -Idin"

Hossein Tohi,"Seyyed Hossein Mousavi, known by his stage name Hossein Tohi (Persian: حسین تهی), is an Iranian rapper. He was born on 26th of January 1986 in the Iranian capital of Tehran. Based on his passion for rap music he started his career already in the age of fifteen. Finally 2 years later, in 2002 he began his professional career as a rap artist. Since 2000 Tohi has created the remarkable number of 40 songs with a variety of subjects such as love songs, religious and society related songs.

The songs ""Raghse Andam"", the dance of the shapes, and ""Keylead"", the key, are two of Tohi's most famous hits that count on a considerable fan community. In an interview Tohi admitted that ""Boghz"", Sobbing, is his own choice as favorite song. Tohi's main, not to say the only target is to cross the Persian speaking boundaries making the Iranian rap internationally noticeable. The diversity of the lyrics in his songs is definitely the reflection of his enthusiastic approach to achieve that target. As of today Tohi's live concerts are holding within the Persian events. So Tohi's potential to come internationally through is predictable by the size of his today's mass appeal. Taking into consideration that his homeland, Iran does not provide sufficient opportunities to such an artist developing himself. Tohi has always succeeded to follow his target highly professional and quick. Tohi loves to support other talented Iranian rap musicians wherever he meets them. So he established his own company called ""Estedade No"", the New Talent to help and promote young artists.

Despite his success, his new style of music has also come under heavy criticism for its western-ism. Tohi does not incorporate Iranian features into his music and this frustrates older generation Iranians, who feel the Persian culture is disintegrating."

Houshmand Aghili,"Houshmand Aghili was born in 1937 in the city of arts and literature, in the historic city of Isfahan, Iran.

Aghili spent his entire life in the city of his birth until he received his bachelors in literature from the University of Isfahan. Aghili's father recognized his vocal talents early on in his childhood and encouraged him to pursue an education in the arts. Aghili's father's steadfast support served as a pillar to further his musical career.

At 13 years of age, Aghili attended vocal lessons, under the supervision of master musician Taj Esfahani, an acclaimed musical instructor of the time. Taj Esfahani familiarized Aghili with various Persian songs and musical arrangements, which served as an important foundation in Aghili's career-to-come.

While Aghili was receiving his musical education, he was invited to perform at ""Radio Isfahan"" and participated in various musical programs that brought further publicity to Aghili's exceptional talents.

Soon afterwards, Aghili was chosen as one of two major vocalists for the Isfahan Student's Orchestra. This brought further notoriety to Aghili's talents, which lead to performances throughout various university-sponsored events, in addition to Iranian, British, American and other organizations and institutions throughout Isfahan. This created a sudden rise in admiration and popularity for Aghili.

Aghili then moved to Tehran where he began his career by working for the Tehran municipality, which lead to a more important position at the department of Expansion, Unification and Development under the supervision of the Iranian prime minister. While working in government posts, Aghili studied journalism and graduated soon after wards, earning a second degree.

Aghili's great love for music propelled him to continue his musical education through private classes, which were instructed by master musicians Mahmoud Karimi and Ismail Khan Mehrtaash.

At the inauguration of the Iranian National Television, Aghili was invited to perform with the prestigious National Orchestra. This allowed Aghili to work closely with many other gifted composers and instrumentalists of the time, including Morteza Hanaaneh and Ghavami. This close partnership allowed Aghili to work with even more musicians, including the famed Farhang Sharif, Nasrollah Zarin Panjeh, Lotfollah Majd, Asghar Bahari and Hassan Nahid; all of which were prominent musicians of the time.

Aghili's work at the department of Expansion, Unification and Development earned him a scholarship through UNESCO and allowed for him to visit the United Kingdom.

After Aghili's return to Iran, he decided to join the ""Fanoos"" organization -- an organization which included the most prominent artists and vocalists of the time, including the Grand Dame of Persian classical music, Delkash. Soon afterwards, Aghili began working closely with his childhood friend, Jahanbakhsh Pazookie and started composing songs that were highly popular among the public. These songs included the acclaimed ""Ey Khoda,"" ""Sheneh Daagh"" (Darya), ""Farda Toh Miaay"" and ""Cheraagheh Khooneh"". The songs were performed and produced at the Caspian Film and Music Studio in Tehran, Iran and were eventually broadcasted and distributed internationally. This production brought immediate stardom to Aghili's burgeoning musical career, and rendered him a gifted classical musician.

The quick advancement in Aghili's career allowed him to work with the most prominent Persian composers, lyricists and arrangers of Iran, including Amir Homayoon Khoram, Ali Tajvidi, Morteza Hananeh and Akbar Mohseni. Together, these gifted musicians, with the help of Aghili's soft and harmonious voice, produced hit songs such as ""Agar,"" ""Ghessehgoo,"" and ""Hamash Jangeh."" The compositions, nearly three decades old, still evoke feelings of nostalgia among those who remember these songs of a distant and fading past.

Afterwards, Aghili's uncanny passion for music fueled him to recreate classic Persian musical pieces, such as ""Morgh-E-Sahar,"" ""Elaaheyeh Naaz,"" ""Taraaneyeh Man,"" ""Karoon,"" ""Khazan-E-Eshgh"" and ""Ou Nayamad."" The songs were compiled on one album and distributed by Caspian Film and Music.

In 1977, shortly before the tumultuous and uncertain years ahead, Aghili moved to the United States where he still resides today.

Aghili's wide range of talents, including a deep affection and appreciation of literature, in addition to a strong connection with the arts, allowed him to create music with an intrinsic understanding of this divine art. Above all, Aghili is, and shall always be, a messenger of memories."

Kayhan Kalhor & Ali Bahrami Fard,"Iranian kamanche virtuoso and innovative composer Kayhan Kalhor is known for his international collaborations with cellist Yo Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble, the Persian-Indian ensemble m: Ghazal = 23569, and the Brooklyn Rider string quartet . I Will Not Stand Alone, is a spellbinding meditation on one of the most difficult stages in his life. Kalhor was part of the Green Movement civil uprising in Tehran, which was later squashed by the Iranian regime after disputed national elections. This was certainly an intense, emotional period, where darkness and violence seemed to be taking over. Through Kalhor's music and its immediate connection to the people, hope prevails.

Kalhor plays a custom-made instrument on this album, the shah kaman (""the king of bows""), built by Australian craftsman Peter Biffin. This new instrument is a variant of the bowed kamanche. With a fifth lower string and a series of sympathetic harmonic strings, its sound is similar to the Western viola or cello, and to the Indian bowed sarangi. Kalhor is joined by frequent member of his ensembles, Ali Bahrami Fard, on the rarely heard, low register, hammered bass santour. This instrument has sound close to that of the piano. Their musical rapport is telepathic as they seamlessly complete each other's elaborate articulations.

The extended, slow and patient ""Between the Heavens and Me"" opens the album, setting the atmosphere for this musical journey. The music reflects both Kalhor's rich musical heritage and his personal life as a musician; he left Iran after the Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s and returned a decade ago. His greatness as a musician and composer shines through the deep tranquility of this composition. The following ""Where Are You?"" is based loosely on a beautiful Kurdish melody, but the Kalhor and Fard version is freer. They transform this traditional theme into a timeless piece of music, their improvisations often sounding like a contemporary viola and piano duet.

""The Laziest Summer Afternoon"" (based on an ancient Persian mode) and ""Dancing Under the Walnut Tree"" (which paints a childhood memory) serve as the interlude in this sonata-like cycle of compositions. The emotional climax of ""Hear Me Cry"" follows. Here, the music gains intensity and goes higher and higher, aiming—literally—for the heavens in the sky. Kalhor and Fard trade roles and shimmering, inspired solos. The conclusion, ""Pluck a Star From the Sky,"" is an attempt to make sense and gain control after the heated climax. This is followed by a short, contemplative variation on the second composition, ""Here I Am Alone Again."" The powerful, steadfast title piece closes the album, symbolizing the popular struggle for freedom and the insistence and power of hope, even after a temporary defeat. This is magnificent music that portrays a timeless, universal, human story about mankind's need for hope and freedom.

Track Listing: Between The Heavens And Me; Where Are You?; The Laziest Summer Afternoon; Dancing Under The Walnut Tree; Hear Me Cry; Pluck A Star From The Sky; Here I Am Alone Again; I Will Not Stand Alone.

Mahan Farzad,"ماهان فرزاد موزیسن جوان گیلانی به همت گالری مستقل تهران به اجرای پرفورمنس می‌پردازد. روز شنبه 22 آبان ماهان که مدتی است آثارش در رسانه‌های مجازی دست به دست می‌شود برای اولین بار آثار شخصی خود را در تهران با همراهی ویژوال افکت و ویدئو آرت اجرا می‌کند. پیش از این هم او به همراه گروه دو نفره آثار ایندی فولک خود را در نشر هنوز اجرا کرده بود.

ماهان فرزاد متولد 1374 در رشت است. از 5 سالگی ساز زدن را با پیانو شروع کرد و بعدها گیتار الکتریک و کمانچه را هم آموخت و گیتار الکتریک ساز اصلی او شد. پس از آن از 17 سالگی آهنگسازی رو به طور شخصی و تجربی شروع کرد.

ماهان به طور مستقل کارهایش را در صفحه ی ساند کلاودش قرار داد و در سال‌های اخیر بخاطر اثار ریمیکس و آهنگسازی‌هایی که با ملودی های سنتی انجام داد توجه مخاطبان را به خود جلب کرد. او هنوز در ایران آلبومی منتشر نکرده است اما موزیسن مطرحی مانند «نیلز فرام» کارهایش را در پروژه‌های کاری خود استفاده می‌کند و با مخاطبان خود به اشتراک می‌گذارد. ماهان هنرمندی چند وجهی است؛ درواقع پروژه شخصی خودش را هم به صورت بی‌کلام و هم با کلام جلو می‌برد، در گروهی دو نفره همراه با سیاوش خشروز موسیقی ایندی-فولک با اشعار انگلیسی تولید می‌کند و همچنین تمرین‌هایش با یک گروه راک را ادامه می‌دهد.

نکته مهمی که باعث شد کارهای ماهان در فضای مجازی بازخورد خوبی داشته باشد میکس‌هایش بود. در واقع او تلاش کرد برخی قطعات موسیقی‌های سنتی مانند محمدرضا شجریان، ذبیحی و یا حتی موسیقی گیلکی فریدون پوررضا را با موسیقی‌های دیگری که خودش ساخته یا دوست دارد ترکیب کند. همچنین موسیقی متن فیلم کوتاه «تهران از چه می هراسد» از علی مولوی و موسیقی متن تئاتر «کابوس های دنباله دار» از مهرداد هنرمند از جمله کارهای او است. چند ماه پیش اجرایی از کارهای شخصی و مستقل خودش در خانه فرهنگ رشت داشت و حالا قرار است آثارش را در تهران اجرا کند.

این پرفورمنس به همت گالری مستقل تهران  برگزار می‌شود که از ابتدای تابستان 95 همکاری خود را با هنرمندان حوزه ی ویدیو آرت، پرفورمنس و هنرهای مفهومی آغاز کرده اند. در این پروژه ها، هنرمندان به گونه های خاص هنری در حوزه های مختلف هنری می پردازند و تحقیقات و تجربیات خود را به اجرا می گذارند. از این رو شنبه های مجموعه مستقل، مهمان گروه‌هایی ویژه خواهد بود و برای بهتر بودن کیفیت ارائه اثر برای هنرمندان، مخاطبان این اجراها محدود خواهد بود .علاقه مندان می توانند جهت تهیه بلیت این برنامه که با نام «ترنزیشن» اجرا می‌شود به سایت تیوال مراجعه کنند."

Fereydoun Farrokhzad,"Fereydoun Farrokhzad was born in ""Gomrok Four Way"" in Tehran, Iran. He was the second of seven children (Amir, Massoud, Mehrdad, Forough, Pouran, Gloria). After graduating from high school he went to Germany and Austria for post secondary education. He got his PhD in political science from the university of Berlin. At a young age Farrokhzad had a passion for poetry and for singing and he turned that passion to reality in 1962 when he started writing poems in Germany which were published in two German newspapers. In 1964 Farrokhzad published his collection of poems called ""Fasleh Digar"" ""(Another Season)"". His book was critically acclaimed and was honored by many famous German poets. Five moths after the release of ""Fasleh Digar"" Farrokhzad received the the Poetry Award of Berlin. For a couple years Farrokhzad was a member of the Munich Academy of Poetry. In 1966 he found his way to the Television and Radio of Munich. On Radio he had a comedy and music progoram which played middle eastern music including music from Iran. On TV he created and produced a show called خيابان های آلپ. In 1967 he returned to Iran and performed on succesful radio and TV shows. His most successful and famous TV show was ""Mikhakeh Noghrei"". The show was wached by millions of Iranianians. On the show Farokhzad introduced and discovered many famous Iranian artists who are famoums now like Sattar, Shohreh, Shahram Solati, Ebi, Morteza, Hamid Shabkhiz, Leila Forouhar, Saeed Mohammadi and many more.
Farrokhzad married twice and both marriages ended in failure. Once in 1962 to a German woman named Ania Buchkowski whom he met at Oxford. She like Farrokhzad also had a passion for poetry and theater and it was after meeting her that Farrokhzad started writing poems. They divorced but they have a son called Rostam. His second marriage was to an Iranian woman which also ended in a divorce.
On August 6, 1992 Farrokhzad was stabbed to death and beheaded with a knife at his home in Bonn, Germany. He was found three days later by his neighbor, his body was found lying in a pool of blood with his dog whimpering beside him. The murder has been treated as a work of the Iranian government intelligent service, because of Farrokhzad's anti-Islamic Republic remarks in his shows, which insulted mainly Ayatollah Khomeini and other leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
He was a great entertainer and trained many Persian singers currently living in Los Angeles. He was known by his supporters to be an educated patriot who spoke out against the Islamic Republic. Farrokhzad was always present during many demonstrations and always spoke out loud and clear against the Islamic Republic."

Ahmad Shâmlu,"Ahmad Shâmlu  is not a singer. he is a Persian poet.
Ahmad Shâmlu  (Persian: احمد شاملو) (December 12, 1925 — July 24, 2000) was a Persian poet, writer, and journalist. His poetry was initially very much influenced by and was in the tradition of Nima Youshij. Shâmlu’s poetry is complex, yet his imagery, which contributes significantly to the intensity of his poems, is simple. As the base, he uses the traditional imagery familiar to his Iranian audience through the works of Persian masters like Hafez and Omar Khayyám. For infrastructure and impact, he uses a kind of everyday imagery in which personified oxymoronic elements are spiked with an unreal combination of the abstract and the concrete thus far unprecedented in Persian poetry, which distressed some of the admirers of more traditional poetry.
Shâmlu  has translated extensively from German and French to Persian and his own works are also translated into a number of languages. He has also written a number of plays, edited the works of major classical Persian poets, especially Hafez. His six-volume Ketab-e Koucheh (The Book of the Alley) is a major contribution in understanding the Iranian folklore beliefs and language.

Aside from his first passion which was poetry, he had a number of other activities which included writing stories and film scenarios, contributing to children’s literature, and journalism."

Ostad Elahi,"Ostad Nur Ali Elahi (Persianاستاد الهی; 1895 - 1974), was an Iranian philosopher, jurist, and musician of Kurdish descent.

Elahi was born on the 11th September 1895 in Jeyhounabad, a small village in western Iran. His father, Hajj Nematollah (1871-1919), was a charismatic mystic and prolific poet who was widely revered as a saint.  Ostad Elahi was a musical child prodigy, becoming a recognised master of the tanbur by the age of nine. He would eventually revive this ancient art, composing over 100 original pieces that he used as the basis for his improvisations. His musical ornamentations and complex playing technique, which for the first time involved the use of all five fingers of both hands, as well as his physical modifications to the instrument itself - namely, the doubling of the higher string so as to dramatically increase its expressiveness - earned him a reputation as an innovator of this art form and a master of the tanbur.

For Elahi, music was primarily a means of engaging in contemplation and prayer. He never performed in public and did not make any recordings of his music in a professional setting. As a result Ostad Elahi remained largely unknown to the general public during his lifetime, notwithstanding the publication of several philosophical treatises in his later years. Following the introduction of his life and works on the occasion of his centenary in 1995, however, he has become much better known. Since the commemoration of his centennial in 1995, eleven CDs of his music have been released. The bulk of the original recordings were made on basic mono tape recording equipment during the 1960s and '70's in the context of informal gatherings with family and friends. These tapes have since been digitally remastered and restored.

Ostad Elahi died on the 19th October 1974 at the age of seventy-nine.

Biography

Shahrum's interest for singing and music manifested at an early age. He started his career in 1990; however, it was not until 1992 that he released his professional debut album titled K-One, promoted by Alireza Amirghassemi,and also with support of persain super star Leila Forouhar , Due to his youth, synergy, and style he gained popularity in a short amount of time.

International popularity came with his second album Atash with hits like Begou Tou Begou and Khater Khah. In 2001 he stopped working with Caltex Records and instead signed on with Taraneh Records. This collaboration yielded couple instant bestsellers. The hit songs Dokhtar Bandari, Yadam Nemireh and Dige Basteh became club favorites. In a 2005 interview with Tapesh, Shahrum talked about his childhood, about his parent's divorce and his mom's short marriage to Googoosh's first husband. Shahrum also, in this interview, blamed Taraneh Records for not promoting his new album Khoshalam enough and delaying its release. His claim was dismissed by the owner of Taraneh, Vartan Avenassian, who cited immaturity of the singer as cause of their tense relationship.

In August 2006 Shahrum's new music video from his latest album Game Over (directed by élan productions), was aired on all Persian satellite channels. Despite his complications with the record company, this album was still released by Taraneh Records.

محسن نامجو,"Mohsen Namjoo was born in 1976 in the city of Torbat-e Jam, Iran and began his musical training at the age of 12, studying under Nasrollah Nasehpour until the age of 18. In 1994 he was offered to study Theatre and Music at Tehran University. He first joined the theater course because the music program at the university wouldn't start for another year. At Tehran University he was a student of Alireza Mashayekhi, Azin Movahed, and other masters. He has also studied Iranian folk music under Haj Ghorbane Soleimani. Since then he has composed the soundtrack for a number of films and many plays. His voice appears in most of his compositions.
He made himself familiar with western music, especially blues and rock. Since 2003 he has started recording parts of his works in Tehran. His first album titled Toranj was officially released in Iran in September 2007. He was also featured in the documentary ""Sounds of Silence"" (D: Amir Hamz + Mark Lazarz) that has been shown in film festivals across the globe. He acted in a feature narrative film called ""Few kilograms of dates for the funeral"" (D: Saman Salur), shown in various festivals. Mohsen Namjoo's first performance outside Iran was in January 2006 at the Tehran Hotspot of the International Rotterdam Film Festival where he played solo. His critics say his music makes a mockery of Persian classical and traditional music because he constantly blends it with western jazz, blues, and rock music, but he said in an interview at one of his studios in Tehran ""I wanted to save Persian music. It does not belong to the present time and cannot satisfy the younger generation. The fact is that Persian music is very close to other styles, and it is possible to mix in other styles with a little shrewdness."""
